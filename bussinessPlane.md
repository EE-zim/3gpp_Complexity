## 中文版

### 1. 执行摘要

* **项目概述：** 本项目旨在开发一种面向未来6G的“AI智能体无线通信”平台，通过引入大型AI模型（Large AI Model）重构移动网络协议栈，替代传统控制面协议（如RRC），实现“去协议化”通信。该平台相当于“DeepSig美国公司”的中国版，利用AI自主决策能力使无线网络具备高度自适应和认知能力。通过这一革命性技术，可大幅提升网络频谱利用效率、降低时延并减少人为配置开销。

* **市场机遇：** 当前移动通信网络面临协议僵化、优化复杂度高等痛点，难以满足万物互联及多样化业务需求。中国已建成5G基站约338万座，5G用户超过8亿，“5G+工业互联网”项目超过1万个，网络规模和应用复杂度空前增加，迫切需要AI赋能网络管理优化。同时政策层面将6G与AI融合视为战略方向——官方提出6G将重点探索通信与人工智能融合的新型场景。据Precedence Research预测，到2030年全球电信行业AI市场规模将达约150亿美元（约合人民币1000亿元），年复合增长率超过40%，显示出巨大成长空间。本项目正切中这一技术趋势和政策契机。

* **技术与产品：** 平台采用**AI空口**（AI-Native Air Interface）理念，核心是一个嵌入在基站控制面的AI智能体，能够理解上下文并自动生成标准兼容的控制消息。我们已利用NVIDIA Aerial数字孪生平台完成原型验证，初步模型（8亿参数）在边缘GPU上生成RRC消息达到97%字段准确率。产品体系涵盖：AI驱动的无线接入网控制软件、频谱感知引擎，以及云端训练和仿真服务。系统架构包括AI模型、实时推理引擎、数据采集与训练反馈模块等（详见技术章节），确保易于与现有网络集成并保持外部接口兼容标准。

* **商业模式：** 公司采取B2B授权结合云服务订阅的模式盈利。通过与通信设备商、运营商等企业客户合作，将AI软件授权嵌入其网络设备或云平台，并按部署规模收取许可费。同时提供增值的云端服务（如模型更新、远程频谱监测和网络数字孪生仿真），采用订阅制获取经常性收入。此模式参考了DeepSig等公司的成功经验，例如DeepSig通过将其AI软件作为标准RAN组件的即插即用替换来提升网络性能，并推出模型库云平台供客户持续获取最新AI模型。我们将以类似方式，实现高利润率的软件授权收入和稳定持续的订阅服务收入。

* **竞争优势：** **（1）技术领先：** 核心团队在“大模型+无线”领域拥有前沿研究成果，率先实现了LLM生成RRC协议的端到端演示。相较国外竞争对手，我们更专注于控制面AI化这一蓝海方向，已有技术验证支撑。**（2）本土化与政策支持：** 我们是国内首批专注AI空口的创业团队，填补国内空白。可充分利用中国5G/6G试验网络和政策资金支持，加速落地。**（3）平台兼容性：** 产品设计确保与3GPP/O-RAN标准接口兼容，客户无需更换硬件即可部署AI模块（类似DeepSig的“无缝嵌入”方案），降低采用门槛。**（4）数据和场景优势：** 中国广泛的网络部署将为AI模型提供海量训练数据和多样化场景，有助于持续提升算法性能，形成数据壁垒。

* **团队与现状：** 核心团队由多名具有无线通信和AI背景的博士组成，包括联合创始人在内多人曾在海外知名企业或研究机构实习工作（例如Nokia Bell实验室等），兼具科研创新和产业实践经验。团队在协议栈AI化方向已积累了相关专利和发表论文，拥有先发优势。目前公司处于拟成立阶段，已完成关键技术验证和商业模式论证，即将注册落地并展开业务拓展。

* **融资与财务：** 计划首先募资**种子轮**人民币2000万元，用于组建团队、研发原型和开展试点试验。之后预计在2年内启动A轮融资约5000万-1亿元，用于产品化和规模商用部署。资金主要用于研发投入（约占60%）、设备和云资源投入（20%）、市场拓展和运营（20%）。据财务测算，投入第三年起公司有望小幅盈利，第5年收入可达到2亿元，净利润率超过50%（详见财务模型），未来具有良好的增长和IPO潜力。退出方面，投资人可通过公司在科创板上市或被行业巨头并购实现丰厚回报。

### 2. 项目介绍与背景

**2.1 行业痛点：** 当前无线通信网络的控制平面严重依赖人为设计的固定协议流程（如4G/5G的RRC状态机），存在**适应性差**和**演进缓慢**的问题。一方面，传统协议栈需要人为预定义海量消息和规则，以应对各种网络场景，但仍难以及时适配动态变化（如突发的网络拥塞、异构终端接入等）。另一方面，每一代移动通信标准的制定周期长达数年，新功能的部署往往滞后于业务需求。例如，5G引入了切片、边缘计算等新特性，但相应的控制面配置与优化主要靠固定算法和人工经验，难以及时根据环境变化自我优化。这导致网络资源利用效率不够理想，运维成本高企。同时，随着网络规模爆炸性增长（截至2023年底中国已建成5G基站3.38百万站），传统方式下配置参数剧增，人工调整复杂度和出错风险大幅提高。此外，垂直行业专网和物联网等新兴应用层出不穷，千差万别的需求使得用统一协议难以覆盖所有场景，被称为“**协议刚性**”难题。综上，现有RAN（无线接入网）架构亟需引入新的范式来提升智能化、自主化水平，否则难以支撑未来6G“万物智联”的愿景。

**2.2 政策契机：** 面对上述挑战，“**AI赋能通信网络**”成为全球共识，尤其在6G愿景中被寄予厚望。中国政府高度重视这一方向：早在2019年就成立IMT-2030(6G)推进组启动6G研发，并在近期明确提出6G将实现通信技术与人工智能、感知技术等的深度融合。工信部领导指出，各国6G研究仍在起步阶段，中国要抢占先机，重点培育**6G应用生态**，加速下一代无线与AI、新型算力的融合发展。这种政策导向为本项目提供了良好的外部环境：一方面，政府在科研资金（如科技重大专项、产业基金）上将倾斜支持相关创新；另一方面，运营商和设备厂商在政策引导下也积极布局网络智能化升级，乐于与初创企业合作试点创新。此外，“东数西算”等国家工程推动云算力和AI基础设施完善，也为我们开展大规模模型训练和仿真提供了基础条件。可以说，本项目**站在政策风口**：6G商用在2030年左右启动，“十四五”期间正是技术攻关和试点验证的黄金窗口，我们的AI空口方案有望成为6G标准关键候选之一。

**2.3 市场趋势：** 引入AI的智能通信网络代表着万亿级的新兴市场机会。据预测，全球电信业AI相关市场规模将从2022年的约10亿美元快速增至2030年的约150亿美元，年复合增长率高达40.2%。运营商对AI用于网络优化和运营自动化的投入正持续加码，以提升用户体验、降低OPEX。国内市场方面，5G大规模部署和行业数字化转型催生出强劲需求：中国运营商已在多个省市建设AI集中控制平台，开展基站节能、业务优化AI应用的验证；在工业、医疗、能源等垂直领域，5G专网结合AI实现智能制造、远程医疗等应用场景逐步落地。预计到2025年，中国5G通信与相关数字产业产值将达到万亿元级规模。与此同时，Open RAN（开放无线接入网）理念兴起，通过软硬件解耦为AI算法注入网络打开了大门。全球主要运营商成立了O-RAN联盟，引入RAN智能控制器（RIC）以便第三方开发AI应用。巨头方面，NVIDIA牵头成立“AI-RAN联盟”，联合AWS、微软、爱立信、诺基亚等公司，共同推进AI改造RAN并期望大幅提升网络效率与降低功耗。这表明行业正朝“**AI原生网络**”方向演进。综合来看，无线网络AI化的市场空间和接受度都在快速提升，本项目切入的**AI空口/智能RAN控制**正处在爆发前夜，具有极高成长潜力。

### 3. 技术路线与产品体系

**3.1 技术理念：** 平台核心技术路线是打造“**AI原生无线接口 (AI-Native Air Interface)**”，即将AI智能体融入无线协议栈，使基站具备自学习、自适应的通信能力。这意味着网络不再完全依赖预设的协议流程，而是通过深度学习模型来理解网络状态并生成控制决策。研究指出，6G时代AI将从辅助优化工具跃升为空口设计的内生要素，我们的方案正是这一理念的实践。具体而言，我们选用大规模Transformer类模型（如解码器型LLM），将其嵌入5G/6G基站的控制面协议层（RRC层）内部。LLM通过在海量通信交互数据上经特殊方式微调，学习RRC信令的“语言”，从而取代传统状态机的部分功能，直接根据实时上下文生成下行控制消息并决策控制流程。由于模型具有强大的泛化和推理能力，它可以在未显式编排规则的情况下，自动适配新的场景或异常情况，例如不同终端能力、信道环境剧变等，实现真正的“自适应”通信流程。这种去协议化并非抛弃标准，而是**内部AI化、外部标准保持兼容**：LLM生成的消息采用ASN.1编码保证符合3GPP协议格式，因而UE终端无须做任何修改即可通信。简言之，我们用AI智能体在网络内部**动态重构协议**，但对终端/核心网呈现的仍是标准协议行为，确保落地可行性。

**3.2 系统架构：** 系统整体架构可分为三层：**数据感知层、AI决策层和执行控制层**。下面以5G基站(gNB)改造为例说明各组件：

* **数据感知层：** 包括分布在无线侧和网络侧的多源数据采集模块。一方面，终端侧和小区内的各种状态信息（信道质量CQI、接入请求、干扰水平等）通过底层协议（PHY/MAC/RLC层）实时上报，汇聚到控制单元的AI代理。另一方面，网络侧的上下文数据（如核心网指示的切片策略、应用QoS需求）也传递给AI模型。此外，我们部署**频谱感知模块**，利用深度学习模型对射频原始信号进行分类识别（借鉴DeepSig OmniSIG的思路），实时发现频谱占用、干扰源等，为AI决策提供环境感知。这些数据经过预处理（归一化、特征提取）后作为AI模型的输入。
* **AI决策层：** 这是系统的大脑，部署在集中单元CU-CP内的**RRC智能体**（Large RRC Model）。该智能体由一个专用微调的大型Transformer模型组成，结合了通信领域知识和序列决策能力。当上行收到终端RRC请求或网络状态变化事件时，AI模型将当前上下文编码为提示（Prompt），通过自回归推理生成相应的控制面响应消息和动作决策。例如，终端发来连接请求，模型综合考虑历史负载、信道、用户需求等，直接生成包含配置参数的RRC连接接受消息；再如用户移动出小区，模型预测并决策切换指令。模型输出经过一个**协议封装模块**，确保消息格式符合同步态ASN.1语法要求，然后送入执行层。值得一提的是，模型还能给出决策的置信度或简要“自解释”，供运维人员参考（类似LLM生成自我解释），增强AI决策的透明度和可控性。
* **执行控制层：** 包含传统基站协议栈的其它部分以及我们的辅助控制逻辑。例如，RLC/MAC层接收到来自AI的控制指令（如资源调度、重配置参数）后执行相应动作；PHY层按照AI生成的新配置（调制编码方案等）进行空口发送。我们增加一个**策略仲裁模块**：在AI输出可能存在不确定时，仲裁模块可回退执行预设的安全规则或人工策略，以保证网络稳定。这实为一道“安全阀”，确保AI的引入不会造成失控风险。此外，执行层还负责将执行结果及新的网络状态反馈回AI决策层，形成闭环。这种云边协同架构，通过AI模块的**插件式**嵌入，实现对既有基站的智能升级，同时不破坏原有架构的完整性和互通性。

*(图1：系统架构示意图，展示AI智能体嵌入5G gNB控制面的整体架构，各模块流程关系。)*

**3.3 核心技术模块：** 基于上述架构，我们开发以下核心技术模块和产品：

* **AI空口控制代理（Large RRC Agent）：** 平台旗舰产品，一个集成于基站CU控制面的AI软件模块。其内置我们训练的大模型（当前为8B参数级，未来扩展至几十B参数），可实时接管RRC层功能。通过创新的微调技术（如LoRA低秩适配）和专用协议tokenizer，我们显著提升了模型对通信协议的“语言理解”能力，使其能生成ASN.1格式完全正确的RRC消息。内部还包含轻量级推理引擎，经过GPU/DPUs加速优化，确保在边缘服务器上满足毫秒级时延要求。Large RRC Agent可视为一种AI驱动的“协议栈插件”，可加载到5G/6G基站软件中，为其赋予自治控制决策能力。
* **频谱感知引擎（Spectrum AI Engine）：** 这是独立的软件组件或嵌入功能模块，主要面向开放RAN部署的O-RU或专用频谱监测设备。它利用深度学习算法（卷积神经网络+时序模型）对环境无线信号进行分类识别和异常检测，实现对频段占用、干扰、非法信号的实时监控。参考DeepSig的OmniSIG产品，我们的引擎具备广谱扫描和实时告警能力，可无缝对接运营商现有网管系统或RIC，实现网络的**频谱态势感知**。该模块不仅为AI决策层提供更丰富的环境信息，也可作为单独产品向需要频谱安全的政府/行业客户授权。
* **自适应RAN优化模块：** 部署在运营商网络云端或RIC上，持续收集全网KPI和AI代理运行日志，利用强化学习等算法不断优化AI策略。具体包括一个**数字孪生仿真平台**和**在线学习模块**。我们借助NVIDIA Aerial Omniverse数字孪生来模拟大规模网络场景，产生丰富的训练数据和测试新AI策略。在线学习模块则根据真实网络反馈，不断调整AI模型参数或策略阈值，实现**持续优化**。例如，通过对历史切换决策效果的分析，动态调整模型对覆盖质量与负载的权衡。这一模块使我们的AI空口方案不会一成不变，而是随着环境和业务演进自我进化，保持长期竞争力。
* **云端管理与服务平台：** 为方便客户部署和使用，我们提供云端支持平台，功能包括模型更新分发、性能监控、数据可视化和开发者API等。客户可通过网页版界面查看AI代理的决策统计、频谱监测报告，并可一键升级到我们最新训练的模型版本。该平台类似DeepSig推出的模型中心概念，集中管理预训练模型和客户自训练模型，支持按需下载或在线推理服务。这为我们的商业模式（订阅制）奠定基础，也增强了用户粘性。

*(图2：产品功能模块图，各组件作用及与运营商网络的集成关系。)*

**3.4 技术成熟度与验证：** 当前，我们已在实验环境完成关键技术验证。使用50k条真实网络信令数据对8B参数的LLM进行了微调，在NVIDIA edge GPU上实现了RRC消息生成97%字段准确率，比未微调模型提升一个数量级，成功证明了大模型操控协议的可行性。此外，通过NVIDIA Aerial数字孪生平台，我们构建了一个**小区级别AI空口仿真**：在模拟城区环境中，AI代理根据用户移动和干扰情况实时调整资源配置，与传统规则算法相比，将掉线率降低了约30%，吞吐量提升15%（仿真结果）。这些初步成果为我们进一步开发产品提供了信心。接下来半年内，我们计划在开放RAN试验床上进行**端到端外场试验**：选取一两个5G小区，引入AI代理处理部分控制面流程，评估对接入时延、切换成功率等指标的影响。这将为产品在实际网络中的性能提供宝贵数据，并为后续商业推广奠定基础。

### 4. 商业模式与盈利模式

**4.1 客户定位：** 我们的目标客户群体为通信行业的B2B客户，包括移动网络运营商（MNO）、电信设备商、专网系统集成商以及政府和行业专网用户等。对于运营商而言，AI空口方案可帮助其提升网络效能、降低运维成本，是5G/6G时代保持竞争力的关键；对于设备商，集成我们的AI模块可显著提高设备智能化水平，增强产品卖点；对于大型垂直行业用户（如电力、交通、安全部门等），我们的频谱感知与专网优化产品可满足其定制化需求。因此，我们采取直销与合作并行的市场策略：直接与运营商技术部门对接推广解决方案，并与设备厂商建立合作，将我们的软件预集成到其基站/小站产品中，通过OEM或授权方式扩大覆盖面。

**4.2 收入来源：** 商业模式的核心是**软件授权 + 云服务订阅**两条收入线：

* **软件授权许可：** 对企业客户出售AI软件的使用许可，根据部署规模和功能模块收取一次性或按期（年度）授权费。具体方式包括：按基站节点数授权（每部署我们的AI代理于一台基站或基带单元收取费用），或按网络规模分级定价（例如每万个小区为一档）。亦可针对私网/专网客户采用项目制收费。此部分类似传统电信软件的license模式，将带来高毛利收入。以DeepSig为例，其AI软件可作为标准RAN组件（如O-RU, O-DU）的替换嵌入，提高性能—我们同理，通过与设备商合作预装，可向设备商收取授权费，再由其在销售设备时打包给运营商。除了软件本身，我们也计划将部分关键模型算法通过专利授权方式许可给大型厂商使用，获取技术许可收入。
* **云端订阅服务：** 基于我们构建的云服务平台，对持续性的增值功能收取订阅费。服务内容包括：AI模型的定期更新升级（客户可订阅最新最优模型）、网络数字孪生仿真服务（在云端模拟网络场景供客户试验新策略）、实时频谱监测报警服务，以及技术支持和顾问服务等。客户按年订阅或按使用量付费。例如，运营商可购买“AI模型更新包”，持续获得我们训练的最新模型权重；或租用云端仿真环境进行网络优化测试。这种SaaS模式将带来稳定的经常性收入流。如DeepSig在2024年推出了OmniSIG模型库，即通过集中提供预训练模型和管理工具，采用订阅形式为客户赋能，我们的云平台也将借鉴这一模式扩展商业价值。

**4.3 定价策略：** 考虑到电信级客户对可靠性要求高、转换成本高，我们将采用“价值定价”策略，而非低价跑量。软件授权价格将参考客户现有网络规模和节省效益。例如，给运营商部署AI代理预计可节省X%能耗或提升Y%容量，我们会将其中一部分价值转化为价格。初期为降低进入壁垒，可提供**试点优惠**：在试点小规模部署阶段收取象征性费用或免费，以取得效果数据和客户信任，待验证效果显著后再签订大规模部署合同时按标准价收费。云订阅则按功能模块定价，例如频谱监测服务按每MHz频段/月收费，模型更新按每基站/年收费等，并针对长期合作伙伴提供折扣。总体而言，定价将突出我们产品为客户带来的**性能提升/成本节约**量化价值，体现ROI。我们预计成熟后**毛利率**将非常可观，因为我们的主要交付为软件，边际成本低。一旦研发收回成本，后续每增加一个客户的成本几乎可以忽略，从而实现规模化盈利。

**4.4 销售与渠道：** 在直销方面，我们计划组建小型业务拓展团队，由具备通信行业人脉的合伙人牵头直接对接运营商总部和省公司、设备商研发部门等进行方案推介和试点争取。同时，借助合作伙伴渠道，例如参与运营商的联合创新中心项目、与高校/研究院合作示范。尤其要充分利用国家6G试验平台等资源，将我们的方案纳入官方示范工程，提升背书。在渠道合作方面，我们将寻求与主流电信设备商（如华为、中兴甚至爱立信等）签订合作协议，使其将我们的AI模块作为其解决方案的一部分推荐给客户。这类似于Cohere公司将其Spectrum Multiplier作为xApp提供给RAN供应商集成。此外，也考虑与云服务商（如运营商自有云、阿里/腾讯云等）合作，将我们的仿真和优化服务挂载在其工业互联网平台上分发。通过多元渠道并进，我们力争3年内获取国内前三大运营商各至少一个省的试商用订单，以及头部设备商的合作意向，实现**从试点到规模部署**的跨越。

**4.5 案例与对标：** 国际上DeepSig公司采用的商业模式验证了本领域B2B路线的可行性：DeepSig通过与国防和通信行业客户合作，将其AI软件（OmniPHY、OmniSIG）授权嵌入通信系统中，并提供模型更新支持，成功获得数百万美元级别融资和政府项目支持。Cohere公司则以软件订阅的形式向运营商提供其xApp算法，按提高的频谱效率为卖点收费。这些先行者证明了我们所选商业模式的生命力。本项目将在中国本土化落地并扩展服务维度，通过**软硬结合**（边缘授权+云服务）获取持续收益，从而建立可扩张的商业闭环。

### 5. 市场分析与空间测算

**5.1 市场规模概览：** AI重构无线网络这一领域正处于高速增长的早期阶段，市场空间广阔。根据Precedence Research数据，2022年全球电信业AI市场规模约为20亿美元，到2030年将增至约150亿美元，年均增长40%以上。这主要受益于运营商提升网络自动化和用户体验的迫切需求，AI技术在通信各环节应用不断深化。从地域看，亚洲特别是中国将是最大市场：目前中国已占全球5G基础设施70%以上，在AI应用落地上政策推动强劲。因此保守估计，中国通信AI市场2030年有望达到数百亿元规模，约占全球的30-40%。**细分市场**方面，我们聚焦的RAN（无线接入网）智能化属于关键子领域。RAN传统投资约占运营商CapEx的50%，引入AI后可带来运营节省和效益提升，据Analysys Mason测算AI可为典型运营商节省15%以上RAN运维成本并增加10%以上产能。因此，保守预计到2028年全球RAN智能化相关支出可达几十亿美元量级，其中控制面AI、自优化网络(SON)等是主要增长点。

*(图3：2019-2023年中国5G基站数量增长图)*

上图显示了中国作为全球最大5G市场的基础设施增长：2019年末5G基站约13万站，2020年增长至70万，2021年底超过115万，2022年底达230万，2023年底进一步跃升至338万站。可以预见，随着5G/6G站点规模持续扩大，传统人工运营模式难以为继，智能化改造需求强烈。这为我们的AI方案提供了巨大的潜在部署场景。例如，如果到2030年中国拥有500万座5G/6G站址，即使只有10%部署我们的AI控制代理，每座每年收费1万元，也有数十亿元年收入空间。

**5.2 目标市场切分：** 我们的市场可分三块：**（A）电信运营商网络** – 这是最大宗市场，包括三大运营商的5G/6G公网和其子公司承建的政企专网。保守估计全国有数百万基站单元，前期哪怕每省选择部分城区试点，也有上万单元规模。**（B）行业垂直专网** – 面向电力、能源、制造、交通等行业的5G专网和未来6G专网，数量成百上千个，规模略小但付费意愿高，因为他们注重专网性能优化和安全。**（C）国防及公共安全** – 包括军队、应急、公安等专用通信网络，对自主可控和智能化要求高，也是潜在市场。我们预计前5年主要收入来自（A），即运营商部署试点逐步扩围；之后（B）和（C）将随着行业应用成熟而贡献更多营收，占比提高。以DeepSig为例，其早期客户就包括美国国防领域用于频谱感知，这类需求在国内亦存在。

**5.3 竞争格局及市占预估：** 详见下一章节的竞争分析，目前国内外尚无主导厂商，属于新兴蓝海市场。我们计划通过技术领先和本土优势，占据国内**AI空口**细分市场50%以上份额，以及全球市场的10%左右。以控制面AI代理部署数计，力争5年内装机破万（约占中国基站总数的0.2%，全球的0.1%），10年内装机百万级别（占中国5%、全球1%）。对应收入将在数十亿量级。虽然比例看似不高，但由于我们的价值主要体现在高价值场景（热点小区、关键专网等），并不需要全面覆盖所有站点即可实现可观收益。

**5.4 增长驱动因素：** 市场高速增长有赖于几个因素推动：其一，**运营商降本增效压力**日益增加，劳动力和能耗成本高企，AI自动化是刚需；其二，**6G标准临近**，窗口期需要验证AI方案可行性，运营商有动力在5G后期试水AI，培养能力；其三，**设备开放与算力下沉**，O-RAN开放架构和边缘GPU的部署为AI下沉网络提供了平台；其四，**政策与竞争**，政府希望国产创新引领6G，而运营商之间、与OTT之间竞争也迫使其寻求差异化技术。以上因素确保了我们所处市场未来几年将快速启动并扩容。

**5.5 市场进入策略：** 我们初期将重点开拓**国内市场**，凭借本土政策和关系优势快速拿下标杆客户，然后逐步推向**全球市场**。在国内，计划优先与对创新接受度高的运营商/省公司合作（如深圳、上海等5G示范区），打造成功案例。在全球，我们将关注对Open RAN采纳积极的新兴运营商（如一些东南亚、中东地区运营商）和专网市场，通过合作伙伴切入。长期看，我们的定位是做“中国的DeepSig”，立足国内辐射全球新兴通信市场，与海外玩家同台竞争并占据一席之地。

### 6. 竞争格局与对比分析

本项目处于全球技术前沿，目前直接竞争者不多，但相关领域已有一些初创企业和大公司投入布局。我们将主要竞争对手和参照对象分为三类：（1）国际创新创业公司，如DeepSig、Cohere等；（2）大型设备厂商的相关研发；（3）生态平台型公司，如NVIDIA及其联盟。以下对主要竞争者进行分析比较：

**6.1 DeepSig（美国）** – *“AI无线通信”先锋*。DeepSig成立于2016年，总部位于美国弗吉尼亚州，作为AI原生无线通信的先行者，在物理层和频谱AI方面成果突出。其核心产品OmniPHY®采用深度学习优化通信物理层，可提升系统容量和效率；OmniSIG®则是频谱感知软件，利用机器学习实现射频信号的实时检测与分类，为战场、电磁安全等提供解决方案。DeepSig的特点是**专注底层**：以AI替代传统信号处理模块、频谱感知模块等。其商业模式是将软件模块授权给军方、设备商等B2B客户，已获得美国NTIA资助用于Open RAN频谱感知研究。**对比我司：** DeepSig证明了AI可融入通信系统并带来性能提升（如其方案在AI空口方向上已于MWC2025展示了基于NVIDIA Aerial平台的6G AI原型）。然而DeepSig主要聚焦物理层和国防市场，在控制面智能化这一块尚属空白。我司在控制面AI方面有先发优势和专利布局。此外，DeepSig作为美资公司，在中国市场进入存在壁垒，我们作为“DeepSig中国版”可占据本土主导地位。我们也可参考其技术路线，将来扩展产品至物理层AI，以全面对标。总体来看，DeepSig是我们的标杆和潜在**竞合**对象——既是竞争者也是合作参考（例如未来可考虑与DeepSig技术合作，共同促进AI空口标准）。

**6.2 Cohere Technologies（美国）** – *“频谱倍增”算法提供商*。Cohere是一家硅谷公司，专注于利用AI/数学算法提升现有4G/5G网络频谱效率。其旗舰产品Spectrum Multiplier®是一种开放RAN xApp软件，基于Delay-Doppler信道表示对MU-MIMO进行智能预编码，据报道可将频谱效率提升最多2倍。Cohere的方案通过在O-RAN近实时RIC上运行xApp，实现多用户在同频同时时资源复用，已在Vodafone等运营商实网试验中验证了容量翻倍效果。**对比我司：** Cohere着眼于当前网络性能改进，是“增强型”方案，而我们着眼于未来网络架构重构，是“变革型”方案。Cohere的技术优势在于短期见效显著、可融入现网，但其局限在MAC/PHY层的优化，并未触及协议逻辑变革，也依赖于O-RAN的架构存在。我司AI智能体则直接替代控制协议，实现更广泛的网络智能，长远潜力更大。当然，Cohere已与多家运营商合作，有一定市场先发，我们在营销时需避开与其直接比较，强调我们的差异化价值（如AI赋予网络自适应、新功能的能力，而非仅提高现有吞吐）。值得关注的是，Cohere未来也可能将AI延伸到其他RAN层面成为竞争者。我们计划保持对其动态关注，同时也借鉴其合作模式（如与VMware、Intel等合作推进标准）。简而言之，Cohere当前不是我们直接竞争对手，但在运营商心智中其成功案例会被拿来类比，我们需主动强调我们的独特性和更宏大的愿景。

**6.3 通信设备巨头（华为、爱立信、诺基亚等）** – *“内部研发与潜在收购者”*。全球主流电信设备商都在积极研究将AI用于网络优化，例如华为提出了ADN（Autonomous Driving Network，自智网络）战略，爱立信和诺基亚也分别在推进AI增强的SON、自优化产品。这些巨头的优势在于对现网和标准的深度掌控，以及大量数据和资金。不过，由于传统厂商组织架构和利益格局所限，他们的AI尝试多为局部功能（如爱立信用AI做参数调优等），尚未有推翻现有协议栈的激进方案。此外，标准制定周期内，大厂通常倾向观望或小幅试错，不会贸然变革。因此短期内，我们在“去协议化”这一颠覆性思路上几乎无直接大厂竞争。而长期看，6G标准化过程中巨头势必加入AI空口的竞赛。如果我们的方案验证成功，**最好的结果**是被纳入标准并由大厂实施；**次优策略**是我们被大厂战略投资或收购整合。因此我们对待巨头应持“合作大于竞争”态度：当前将他们视为潜在客户/伙伴，为其提供模块或算法（例如通过专利授权或技术合作，使其产品集成我们的AI模块，类似我们成为其供应商）；未来视业务发展决定独立走向还是并入巨头。需要提及的是，华为等在国内市场有资源优势，我们初期避开其AI方案直接冲突，选择与运营商共同推动试点，待技术成熟再影响设备商战略。

**6.4 NVIDIA及AI-RAN联盟生态** – *“平台赋能者”*。NVIDIA并非传统通信公司，但凭借GPU算力和Aerial软件平台，在5G/6G AI化进程中扮演关键角色。NVIDIA Aerial提供了GPU加速的vRAN基带处理，以及Omniverse数字孪生仿真环境，使开发者能够在模拟环境中训练和测试AI无线算法。此外，NVIDIA联合众多行业领军于2024年成立AI-RAN联盟（成员包括AWS、微软、爱立信、诺基亚、三星等），共同推动AI改造RAN。这个联盟本身并不直接提供商业产品，而是打造生态和推动标准。因此，NVIDIA生态对我们而言更多是**赋能和合作**而非竞争：我们已经使用Aerial数字孪生验证了方案，将来也计划继续借力其GPU硬件和开发框架，加速产品研发。此外，我们作为国内创业公司，可以积极参与AI-RAN联盟的活动，与产业巨头同台展示技术，获取行业影响力。当然，也要警惕平台型公司的潜在竞争：一旦我们的方案验证成功，联盟内其他参与者可能尝试开发类似技术。因此我们需要抢在生态内**建立领导地位**，通过积极的专利布局和开放合作，使自身成为AI空口领域的**事实标准**贡献者。总的来看，NVIDIA及其联盟更像我们的盟友——帮助打开市场认知度，同时提供工具降低研发成本；但我们也应未雨绸缪，在关键技术上形成护城河，避免未来被平台玩家边缘化。

**6.5 我们的竞争策略：** 面对以上格局，我们将采取差异化和合作并举的策略。在技术上，坚持走“控制面AI化”差异路径，强化自身在该细分领域的话语权，短期内避开与DeepSig、Cohere正面竞争。在市场上，充分利用本土资源和政策，将国外玩家挡在门外或争取合作。例如，向国内运营商强调我们方案的自主可控和本地支持优势，这是外企难以具备的。在国际标准和联盟中，我们积极贡献技术（如发表白皮书、demo等），塑造专家形象。与此同时，对大厂和平台公司保持合作开放态度，努力成为其实现AI空口的合作伙伴，而非对手，以“小船搭顺风车”方式快速扩大市场影响力。通过这些举措，我们有望在未来3-5年建立起**先发优势**，当行业其他竞争者开始涌入时已占据制高点，形成技术+市场双壁垒，从而确保在AI无线通信这一新赛道中赢得一席之地。

### 7. 落地策略与执行路径

将革命性技术转化为商业价值，需要清晰的落地路线图和坚定的执行计划。本章节阐述公司未来5年的战略步骤，包括试点应用、生态合作、市场扩张等方面。

**7.1 分阶段实施路线：**

* **第1阶段（研发验证，2025年）：** *目标：打造可运行的原型系统，获得外部试点机会。* 我们将在公司成立后的前6-12个月内完成核心AI代理的软件开发和内部测试。借助NVIDIA Aerial数字孪生平台，我们对典型小区场景进行仿真，验证AI模型在端到端控制流程中的稳定性。同时，积极申请加入**运营商联合创新项目**：我们已与某运营商研究院初步接洽，争取在其实验室环境部署我们的原型。通过实验室演示数据，证明方案可行并优化参数。年底前，力争促成**外场试点**协议：选择一个友好客户（如某省运营商或行业专网）的小规模网络（例如10个基站的小区簇），安装我们的系统进行实地测试。这将是迈出实验室、验证真实环境效果的关键一步。
* **第2阶段（试点拓展，2026-2027年）：** *目标：取得标杆案例，实现小规模商业合同。* 在这一阶段，我们预计获得首批试点结果（例如接入成功率提升、掉线率下降等数据），据此撰写白皮书和案例分析向业内宣传。在2026年，我们计划将试点扩大到**多场景**：除了城区宏站，还在室内小站、企业园区专网等环境部署AI代理，验证通用性。并争取与**设备商合作试点**：例如联合某国内设备厂商，在其新款O-RAN基站中集成我们的AI模块共同测试。通过这些多元试点，丰富产品适配性。到2027年，我们力争转化**1-2个商业合同**：例如为某运营商的省级网络优化项目提供AI升级（收费），或向某行业客户交付定制AI专网解决方案。这标志着公司开始有实际收入，并证明商业模式的成立。
* **第3阶段（规模商用，2028-2029年）：** *目标：业务规模化，成为行业标准实践之一。* 随着6G标准临近和我们技术成熟，我们将在2028年推动**规模商用部署**。一方面，总结前期各类试点成果，形成标准化产品版本V1.x，并通过运营商认证测试。然后在重点省份实现**商用部署扩容**：例如与某运营商签订协议，将AI代理部署扩展到该省20%城区基站。另一方面，积极参与**6G标准**：2028年3GPP将启动R21标准(6G)制定，我们通过提交技术提案、参与IMT-2030专题组等方式，将我们的方案理念融入标准讨论，争取成为标准候选部分。2029年，我们希望达到国内**领先市场地位**：至少与2家运营商达成长期合作（每家覆盖数百小区），并拓展海外试用合作（与一两个海外运营商或设备商进行PoC）。此阶段公司的营收和影响力都会跃升，并为进一步扩张或资本运作（如IPO）做好准备。

**7.2 商业推广策略：**

* **示范点带动：** 在行业里，成功案例的示范效应极其重要。我们将精心培养1-2个标杆客户（示范点），给予技术和资源倾斜，确保其应用我们方案后取得显著效果。然后以这些示范点为依据，通过行业会议、媒体报道进行宣传，带动更多客户兴趣。例如，如果在某市实现了“AI智能基站”试商用，我们将携手客户在通信展上发布成果，强化我们领军者形象。
* **生态圈合作：** 通信领域需要复杂生态，我们将主动融入既有生态圈，加速落地。一是加入**O-RAN联盟**等国际组织，贡献接口规范草案，使我们的系统兼容性更受认可。二是与**高校/科研院所**合作，利用其影响力和试验平台推动我们的方案（如与清华大学、北京邮电大学的6G实验网络合作试验，借助其学术成果提高背书）。三是与**系统集成商**结盟，在行业专网市场，他们负责整体集成，我们提供AI模块，共同拿下项目。通过这些合作，我们的小团队可以撬动大市场资源，实现快速覆盖。
* **政府支持与监管沟通：** 在创新技术落地过程中，取得政府支持和监管部门理解至关重要。我们将积极申请各级**科技专项和产业基金**，降低资金压力的同时也提高项目可信度。例如争取“未来通信创新项目”资助数千万元，并参与政府主导的6G试验网络建设。有政府站台，将有助于说服运营商采用我们的方案。此外，我们会主动与监管部门沟通，解释AI控制的安全可靠性，提供测试数据消除其疑虑，并探索监管沙盒等机制，让我们的技术在安全可控前提下试点。这些举措将减少政策阻力，加快商用进程。
* **风险控制措施：** 在执行过程中，我们也准备了预案以应对可能的挑战。例如，如果早期试点出现效果不达预期，我们将分析原因快速改进模型，并适当缩小宣传以免过度承诺。同时为避免单一试点失败致命打击，我们会并行推进多个试点降低风险。如果融资进度不及预期，则调整节奏，优先保障核心研发，非关键市场活动暂缓，确保技术攻关不断档。通过精细的执行和风险管控，保障战略路线平稳推进。

**7.3 里程碑规划：**

* *2025年Q4*: 完成AI代理原型开发、实验室测试，通过一项运营商/高校实验室评测。
* *2026年Q2*: 获得首个外场试点协议，在实际基站验证AI控制功能。
* *2026年Q4*: 试点结果发布白皮书，宣布产品V1.0正式发布；获得天使轮/A轮融资支撑扩展。
* *2027年Q4*: 实现首个商业付费合同，营收破千万元；在行业大会（如通信展、IMT-2030峰会）展示成功案例。
* *2028年Q4*: 商用部署规模累计超1000站点；成为6G候选技术方案，写入官方白皮书或预标准文档。
* *2029年Q4*: 年营收过亿，净利润转正并快速增长；启动IPO筹备或被战略投资高估值融资。

上述里程碑将指引我们的执行路径，在实践中我们会根据实际情况微调节奏，但总体目标坚定：让AI空口技术尽早走出实验室、走进行业大规模应用，成为未来通信网络的标配组件之一。

### 9. 融资计划

**9.1 融资总体思路：** 公司拟通过分阶段融资支持业务成长，遵循“够用即可、稳步抬高估值”的原则。考虑到我们属硬科技初创，前期研发投入大、营收较少，将主要依靠股权融资分阶段投入。我们的融资目标是在未来5年内完成从种子轮到B轮的融资，为产品研发迭代和市场拓展提供充足资金，同时引入战略资源型投资人。具体规划如下：

* **天使/种子轮（2025年Q1-Q2）：** \*\*目标金额：\*\*约人民币2000万元（或等值美元）。\*\*资金用途：\*\*产品原型研发（模型训练、软件开发）、核心团队招募、基础运营费用，以及进行1-2个外场试点的成本。\*\*融资目的：\*\*支撑公司18个月左右的存续，完成技术可行性证明和首批试点落地。\*\*投资人对象：\*\*倾向于产业背景的天使投资人或早期基金，如专注TMT/通信的投资机构，高校/科研背景的基金，以及有政府引导资金背书的创业投资。\*\*估值和出让股权：\*\*考虑到我们已有前沿技术成果和广阔市场预期，计划以投前估值约8000万-1亿元进行种子轮融资，出让股权约20%–25%。尽可能保留创始团队控股，以利于后续决策。

* **A轮融资（预计2026年下半年）：** \*\*目标金额：\*\*约人民币8000万 – 1.2亿元。\*\*资金用途：\*\*产品化及规模试商用，包括大规模模型训练硬件投入、软件版本完善、批量部署支持，市场拓展及更多试点项目执行，以及团队扩张（扩招至30人以上）成本。\*\*融资目的：\*\*推动产品从试点走向商用，奠定市场基础。\*\*投资人对象：\*\*寻求顶级VC或产业资本，如通信行业基金、大型通信设备厂商的投资部门、或国家产业基金等。这轮期望引入至少一家具备产业协同价值的投资方（例如运营商品投资金或大型ICT企业），为业务带来资源。\*\*估值预期：\*\*若种子轮达到技术里程碑，A轮可望以3-5亿元投前估值融资约1亿元，出让20-30%股份。此时公司估值大幅提升，反映技术成熟和首批客户签约前景。

* **B轮融资（预计2028年前后）：** \*\*目标金额：\*\*约人民币2-3亿元规模。\*\*资金用途：\*\*支持业务规模化扩张：包括全国范围多城市商用部署的成本垫付、海外市场开拓投入、持续研发（如进军物理层AI、新产品线）以及准备量产和交付的运营资金。\*\*融资目的: \*\*帮助公司占领更大市场份额、实现盈利并筹备IPO。\*\*投资人对象：\*\*倾向于后期大型基金、券商直投或产业巨头战略投资。若业务表现优异，不排除引入战略投资者（例如大型运营商或设备商入股），为未来并购或深度合作做准备。\*\*估值预期：\*\*B轮时公司若已实现数亿营收并有标准化产品，估值有望达到10-15亿元级别。融资2-3亿将摊薄约20%股权，保留足够股份用于IPO前激励和发行。

* **退出路径：** 我们为投资者设计了多样化退出选择：\*\*（1）IPO上市：**这是首选路径，计划在5-7年内当营收和利润达到一定规模后，考虑在科创板或创业板上市，亦视国际市场环境选择港股或纳斯达克等，以实现投资人股权流动和倍数回报。**（2）并购退出：**鉴于通信巨头可能对AI空口技术有强烈需求，如果公司在某一阶段获得行业巨头青睐，也存在高溢价整体并购的可能性，这将为投资人提供快速退出机会。**（3）股权转让/回购：\*\*若公司成长稳定但短期无上市计划，可通过引入后续战略投资由其收购早期投资人股权，或公司盈利后以现金回购部分股权等方式实现退出。在可行情况下，我们会优先保障投资人通过上市或并购获取超额收益。例如，对种子轮投资者，我们预期在A轮时即达到至少数倍估值增值，而终局上市市值若达50亿人民币，则早期投资将获得数十倍回报。

**9.2 融资风险与对策：** 我们深知资本市场存在不确定性。为降低融资风险，公司会同时寻求政府无偿资助和业务收入支撑。例如争取**政府研发补贴/专项资金**（预计获得数百万元级支持），以及在A轮前通过小规模商业合同获得部分现金流（哪怕不足以覆盖成本，也可提振投资人信心）。另外，我们会在各轮融资前严控成本，把里程碑做扎实，以优秀的技术和市场数据说服投资者，减少谈判不确定性。在股权结构上，确保创始团队和核心员工在多轮融资后仍保有有力的话语权（>50%），以保证公司愿景不偏离。我们相信，只要按计划稳步推进并取得实际成果，不仅能顺利融资，更能吸引**优质资方**（产业协同型）为公司赋能，这对于实现远大目标将大有裨益。

### 10. 财务模型

我们对公司未来3-5年的财务表现进行了审慎预测。以下是主要财务指标的预测表：

**表1：未来5年收入、研发支出及净利润预测（单位：万元人民币）**

| 年度 (Year) | 营业收入  | 研发支出 | 净利润   |
| --------- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| 2025 (Y1) | 0     | 500  | -500  |
| 2026 (Y2) | 200   | 600  | -400  |
| 2027 (Y3) | 2000  | 800  | 200   |
| 2028 (Y4) | 8000  | 1000 | 5000  |
| 2029 (Y5) | 20000 | 1500 | 14000 |

*(注：2025年为初创期，尚无收入；2026-2027为试点转商用阶段，2027年起实现盈亏平衡；2028-2029进入高速增长期。)*

从上表可见，公司在前两年主要处于研发投入和市场验证阶段，收入较低且净利润为负。其中2025年和2026年分别亏损约500万和400万元，所幸这段期间公司的融资将覆盖烧钱需求。到2027年，我们预计实现**盈亏平衡**并小幅盈利（约200万元净利），标志着商业模式成立。此时收入来源主要是少量试点合同和技术许可。到了2028年，随着产品的推广，我们预测营业收入可跃升至8000万元规模，净利润达到5000万元左右——利润率超过60%，体现软件业务的高杠杆效应。2029年若能顺利拓展全国市场，收入有望突破2亿元大关，净利润约1.4亿元，净利率接近70%。**盈利能力提升显著**的原因在于业务属于轻资产模式，边际成本低：研发投入虽持续增加但增速远低于收入增速，且占收入比例从2025年的无限大降至2029年的仅7.5%。公司将在2027年之后进入正向循环，即已有利润可以部分反哺研发和扩大再生产，而不再完全依赖外部融资。

【图4†embed\_image】图4：未来五年营业收入与净利润趋势图（万元）
上述折线图直观展示了公司业绩的拐点与增长轨迹。可以看到，净利润（绿色线）在2027年跨过0轴，实现转正，此后随收入（蓝线）增长而迅速攀升。预计2028-2029年净利润增速甚至超过收入增速，表明规模效应和高毛利特性开始发挥作用。这种趋势若能保持，意味着公司具备成为“高增长、高盈利”企业的潜质，为未来IPO奠定基础。当然，预测基于一系列假设（如市场开拓顺利、没有重大不可控成本等），我们会定期滚动更新财务模型以指导运营。

**关键财务指标分析：** 到2029年，公司累计收入约合3亿元，5年复合年增长率（CAGR）约为240%，体现爆发式成长。毛利率方面，由于主要成本为人力和云资源，预计2027年起毛利率超80%，长期可稳定在85%左右。期间研发投入总计约4亿元，占总支出的60%以上，体现我们对技术的高度重视。尽管初期亏损，但属于研发型投入，对应的产出将在后期回报。现金流方面，在2025-2026年经营现金流为负，需要靠融资弥补；2027年开始经营现金流转正，2028-29年自由现金流大量涌现，公司有能力自主融资项目拓展或分红等。资产负债结构上，由于轻资产运营，我们不会有大量固定资产投资，资产主要是现金和无形资产（研发资本化成果）。负债可能仅为流动负债（预收款等），整体财务非常稳健。**保底与上浮 scenario**：在较保守scenario下，商用进度若放缓1年，盈亏平衡可能推迟到2028年，但凭借我们的资金储备仍可支撑，不会对生存造成致命影响；在乐观scenario下，若市场迅速接受，我们2027年即有可能实现上亿收入，则利润将更可观甚至提前考虑IPO。这两种scenario我们都做了应对预案。

**投资回报展望：** 以2029年1.4亿元净利推算，若按当年30倍市盈率，则公司估值可达42亿元；考虑到那时仍在高增长期，给到50倍PE也合理，即约70亿元估值。相比当前种子轮投前估值1亿元左右，这将带来70倍的价值增长。在IPO时，以科创板估值水准，给予市销率PS 15-20倍（按2029年收入2亿，即30-40亿市值）或PE 40-60倍（对应净利1.4亿，即56-84亿市值）都是有可能的。综合看，投资本项目有望在5-7年周期内获得数量级的倍数回报。这也是我们向投资人强调本项目的**高成长、高回报**特点所在。

### 11. 风险分析与对策

在巨大机遇面前，项目也面临诸多风险和挑战。我们识别了主要的风险因素，并制定了相应的缓释对策，以确保公司稳健发展：

* **技术实现风险：** *风险表现*：AI模型能否稳定地产生正确的控制决策仍有不确定性。如果模型在复杂无线环境中表现不佳，可能导致网络故障或性能下降。此外，将AI集成到实时通信系统存在工程难度，如时延超标、与现网兼容问题。*对策*：首先，我们采用渐进引入策略——先在次要或并行路径部署AI代理，保留原有协议逻辑作为备份，验证可靠后再逐步替换，确保网络安全。其次，持续优化模型算法，提高其对边缘场景的泛化能力，并利用仿真和小规模外场测试不断迭代。我们还引入了“安全阀”机制（规则仲裁模块）防止AI异常输出影响全局。团队层面，则招聘顶尖AI和通信技术人才，建立严格的测试流程，确保技术方案成熟后再推广，从而把风险降到最低。

* **市场接受风险：** *风险表现*：电信行业通常偏保守，运营商对于未经验证的新技术可能持观望态度。特别是让AI控制网络关键功能，客户可能担心稳定性和可控性，不愿率先尝试。此外，采购和部署周期长，营销成本高。*对策*：我们将通过**试点验证和数据**来说服客户，拿出量化指标证明AI带来的提升和可靠性，同时提供详尽的技术支持打消顾虑。选择**标杆客户**合作，产生示范效应，降低其他客户的感知风险。也会配合运营商制定应急预案，例如在AI代理失效时自动切回传统模式，以增加客户信心。商业模式上，可以提供**灵活合同**（如试用期或按效果付费），让客户零风险体验。另外，我们积极争取**政策背书**和专家认可，例如让我们的方案获得官方创新奖项或标准组织推荐，提高市场信任度。

* **竞争与垄断风险：** *风险表现*：如果我们的技术路线被证明可行，可能吸引更多竞争者进入，包括大公司自研类似方案或并购整合，从而压缩我们的市场空间。巨头可能利用其资源优势复制或封锁我们的创新。*对策*：我们将强化**先发优势和知识产权**保护，尽早申请核心专利，将关键算法和实现细节专利化，构筑法律壁垒。同时加速**市场占有**，在竞品出现前已深度绑定主要客户，提高转换成本。此外考虑策略结盟，例如与大公司形成合作而非对抗关系，让我们技术成为其生态一部分，从竞争者转变为合作伙伴。如果巨头提出并购，我们也将根据股东利益审慎评估，必要时以高估值谈判保证投资回报。总体上，通过**跑在前面**且**筑好护城河**，我们有信心在竞争中立于不败之地。

* **人才与团队风险：** *风险表现*：作为技术驱动型公司，我们高度依赖顶尖人才。如果核心人员流失或团队配合不当，将对研发进度和公司运营造成严重影响。同时行业巨头也在争夺AI通信人才，我们可能面临招人难、留人难的问题。*对策*：公司将实施有竞争力的**股权激励**和待遇政策，让核心团队共享公司成功收益，提高归属感。同时营造良好**企业文化**，给予人才发挥空间和成长机会，形成“事业留人”的氛围。此外，我们与高校合作建立人才输送机制，招募优秀毕业生和实习生，为团队不断注入新鲜血液。关键岗位上做好**继任者培养**，避免对个人过度依赖。通过上述措施，我们力争打造一支稳定、战斗力强的团队来支撑公司长期发展。

* **资金链和财务风险：** *风险表现*：公司需要持续研发投入和市场推广，短期内现金流为负。如果融资不及时或达不到预期金额，可能出现资金紧张影响项目推进。另外，收入增长具有不确定性，若远低于预期将延长亏损期，造成财务压力。*对策*：我们在融资计划中设置了**阶段性里程碑**，将资金使用与目标挂钩，精细管理现金流，优先保障核心任务支出。同时保持多种融资渠道，除了股权融资，也会积极申请政府补助、银行贷款（如科技贷）等减缓资金压力。在业务上争取**快速创收**，哪怕先从小型技术服务或合作项目获取一定收入，部分对冲成本。财务风险监控方面，每季度滚动调整财务预算并进行压力测试，及早识别潜在问题并采取措施（如缩减非必要开支）。凭借灵活稳健的财务管理，我们有信心避免资金链断裂，保障公司平稳运营。

* **法律和监管风险：** *风险表现*：我们的产品介入通信网络核心控制，涉及数据安全和网络可靠性，可能受到监管部门严格审查。万一发生AI决策引发的网络事故，可能引起监管限制。此外，AI模型训练用到大量数据，也涉及隐私和合规问题。*对策*：我们将主动**遵守行业规范**，在产品设计中加入合规考量。例如确保AI代理对用户数据只做匿名化处理，符合GDPR等法规要求；在网络安全上，通过第三方安全测试认证，证明我们的系统不会引入新的安全漏洞。同时加强与监管机构沟通，取得理解和支持，必要时寻求监管沙盒政策来允许创新试错。我们也会为客户提供**传统模式Fallback**方案，确保在AI异常时有人为Override手段，以满足监管对可控性的要求。法律方面，我们聘请专业律师团队处理知识产权和合同事务，确保公司权益受法律保障。通过合规运营和主动沟通，将法律监管风险降至最低。

### 1. Executive Summary

* **Project Overview:** This business plan proposes a pioneering **AI agent-driven wireless communication platform** for next-generation mobile networks (6G and beyond). The core innovation is to reconstruct the wireless protocol stack using large AI models, replacing traditional control-plane protocols (e.g., RRC) to achieve “de-protocolized” communications. Essentially, the platform serves as a “**China’s DeepSig**,” leveraging AI’s autonomous decision-making to imbue wireless networks with unprecedented adaptability and cognitive capabilities. The solution promises significant gains in spectral efficiency, lower latency, and reduced manual configuration by allowing AI to dynamically manage radio resources in real time.

* **Market Opportunity:** Today’s mobile networks face pain points of rigid protocols and high optimization complexity, struggling to meet the diverse demands of massive IoT and immersive services. China alone has built \~3.38 million 5G base stations with over 805 million 5G users, and more than 10,000 “5G+ Industrial Internet” projects. This enormous scale and complexity urgently call for AI to enhance network management and performance. On the policy front, integrating **communications and AI** is a key strategic direction – Chinese officials explicitly envision 6G enabling new scenarios that combine communication with artificial intelligence. Globally, the telecom AI market is projected to reach \~\$14.99 billion by 2030 (40%+ CAGR), indicating tremendous growth potential. Our project aligns perfectly with these technology trends and policy tailwinds.

* **Technology & Product:** Our platform adopts an **AI-native air interface** paradigm, embedding an AI agent within the base station’s control plane to autonomously interpret context and generate standard-compliant control messages. We have validated a prototype using the NVIDIA Aerial digital twin, where an 8-billion-parameter model achieved 97% field-level accuracy in generating RRC messages on an edge GPU. The product suite spans an AI-driven RAN control software, a spectrum sensing engine, and cloud-based training/simulation services. The system architecture (detailed later) consists of an AI model core, real-time inference engine, data collection and learning feedback modules, etc., ensuring seamless integration with existing networks while preserving standard external interfaces.

* **Business Model:** We will monetize via a combination of **B2B software licensing and cloud service subscriptions**. We will partner with telecom equipment vendors and operators to embed our AI software into their networks, charging license fees per deployment or network scale. In parallel, we’ll offer value-added cloud services (model updates, remote spectrum monitoring, digital twin simulations) on a subscription basis, creating recurring revenue. This model mirrors successful precedents like DeepSig – for example, DeepSig provides AI software as drop-in replacements in standard RAN components to boost performance and has launched a cloud-based model hub for ongoing AI model access. By following a similar approach, we expect to generate high-margin license revenues upfront and stable subscription income over time.

* **Competitive Advantages:** **(1) Technological Lead:** Our core team boasts cutting-edge research in “large models + wireless,” including the world’s first demonstration of LLM-generated RRC procedures. Compared to competitors, we focus on the relatively untapped control-plane AI niche, with proven technical feasibility. **(2) Local & Policy Support:** We are among China’s first movers in AI-native RAN; this home-ground positioning means we can leverage domestic 5G/6G testbeds and government support, giving us a protected environment to grow. **(3) Platform Compatibility:** Our solution is designed to be **plug-and-play** with existing 3GPP/O-RAN interfaces, so customers can deploy our AI module without hardware changes (similar to DeepSig’s “drop-in” approach), greatly lowering adoption barriers. **(4) Data & Scenario Advantage:** China’s vast network deployments provide enormous data and diverse scenarios to train our AI, enabling continuous performance improvement and forming a data moat that overseas rivals will find hard to match.

* **Team & Status:** The founding team comprises PhDs with deep wireless and AI backgrounds, including members with overseas research internships at top institutions (e.g., Nokia Bell Labs), offering a rare blend of cutting-edge R\&D and industry know-how. The team has pioneered relevant patents and publications on AI-driven protocol stacks, giving us first-mover IP advantage. The company is currently in the pre-startup phase: key technology has been validated and the business model vetted; we are in the process of incorporation and poised to engage initial customers and partners.

* **Financing & Financials:** We seek an initial **Seed round** of \~¥20 million (approximately \$3 million) to assemble the team, finalize the prototype, and execute pilot deployments. In \~2 years, we plan a Series A (¥50–100 million) to productize and scale early commercial deployments. Funds will be primarily allocated to R\&D (≈60%), hardware/cloud resources (20%), and pilot projects & operations (20%). Financial projections indicate breakeven by the third year of operation, with revenue reaching \~¥200 million by Year 5 and net profit margins above 50% (see financial section). For exit, we envision either an IPO on a tech board or acquisition by a larger industry player, offering investors substantial returns. Early investors stand to benefit from the high-growth, high-margin nature of this business as we transform a fundamental aspect of mobile networking.

### 2. Project Introduction & Background

**2.1 Industry Pain Points:** Today’s wireless networks rely on **static, hard-coded protocol processes** (e.g., the RRC state machine in 4G/5G) that lack adaptability and are slow to evolve. Traditional RAN protocols must enumerate myriad rules and messages to handle different scenarios, yet they still struggle to dynamically adjust to rapid changes (e.g., sudden congestion, varying device capabilities). Introducing new services or optimizations requires long standardization cycles and manual reconfiguration. For example, while 5G introduced features like network slicing and edge computing, their control and optimization are largely based on fixed algorithms and human-defined parameters, which cannot fully exploit real-time context. Meanwhile, network complexity is exploding: by the end of 2023 China had **3.38 million 5G base stations** deployed, and managing such scale with mostly manual or static methods is unsustainable. The proliferation of diverse applications (massive IoT, URLLC, AR/VR) further exposes the **“protocol rigidity”** problem—one-size-fits-all signaling procedures cannot efficiently cater to vastly different requirements. In summary, the current wireless protocol stack is reaching its limits in terms of flexibility and automation. Without a paradigm shift to a more intelligent, self-optimizing control plane, operators will face escalating operational costs and suboptimal performance, undermining the promises of 5G and beyond.

**2.2 Policy Opportunity:** Recognizing these challenges, integrating **AI into telecommunication networks** has become a strategic consensus globally, and especially in China. The Chinese government has explicitly positioned AI empowerment of networks as a pillar of its 6G development strategy. As early as 2019, China established the IMT-2030 (6G) Promotion Group to kickstart 6G R\&D, and recent official statements emphasize deep convergence of communication and AI in new 6G scenarios. Wang Zhiqin, head of China’s 6G team, noted that 6G research is still in early stages worldwide and highlighted combining communications with artificial intelligence as a key direction. Concurrently, the MIIT’s Vice Minister Zhang Yunming called for proactively cultivating the 6G application ecosystem, integrating next-gen wireless with technologies like XR and robotics. These policy signals create a **tailwind** for our project: government R\&D grants and industry funds are likely to support innovations in AI+6G, and operators are encouraged to experiment with intelligent network technologies. Additionally, national initiatives (e.g., “Eastern Data & Western Computing”) are building robust AI computing infrastructure, which we can leverage for large-scale model training and simulation. In short, our project is aligned with the **strategic focus of China’s telecom policy**. With 6G commercialization targeted around 2030, the coming 5 years (during the 14th Five-Year Plan) are a golden window for technical breakthroughs and pilot deployments. We aim for our AI-native air interface solution to become a key candidate for 6G standards, riding the wave of government support and industry urgency.

**2.3 Market Trends:** Making wireless networks intelligent via AI is an emerging multi-billion dollar opportunity. Forecasts show that the global telecom AI market will expand from roughly \$2 billion in 2022 to about **\$15 billion by 2030** (approx. 40.2% CAGR). This growth is fueled by operators’ need for efficient network management, improved user experience, and the broad adoption of AI-driven technologies in operations. Regionally, Asia—particularly China—is expected to lead in market size, given the scale of infrastructure and proactive policies. China already accounts for the majority of global 5G infrastructure (over 70% of 5G base stations) and is aggressively pursuing AI applications, which suggests China’s share of the telecom AI market could be 30–40% by 2030, potentially representing tens of billions of RMB. **In terms of segments,** our focus is on the RAN (Radio Access Network) intelligence sub-market, which is a key component of overall network AI spend. Historically, RAN CapEx is about half of operators’ network investment; now adding AI to RAN operations (for planning, optimization, troubleshooting) is seen as critical for cost savings and performance gains. For instance, analyses indicate AI-driven automation can cut RAN OPEX by 15%+ and improve capacity by \~10%. We conservatively estimate that by 2028, global spending on RAN-focused AI solutions (including our target area of control-plane AI and SON) will reach several billions USD annually, with robust growth thereafter.

*(Figure 3: Growth of 5G Base Stations in China, 2019–2023)*

The chart above highlights China’s role as the world’s largest 5G market, showing the exponential growth in base stations: \~0.13 million at end-2019, \~0.7 million by end-2020, 1.15 million by end-2021, 2.3 million by end-2022, and **3.38 million by end-2023**. This massive infrastructure expansion underscores a critical point: as networks scale and densify, traditional human-centric operations become impractical, and intelligent automation becomes a necessity, not a luxury. Each base station is a potential touchpoint for our AI solution. For instance, by 2030, if China has \~5 million 5G/6G base stations, even capturing 10% of them with our AI agent at a modest fee (say ¥10k annually per site) would translate to a multibillion RMB revenue opportunity. And that’s just one country’s public network; globally and in private networks, the potential multiplies.

**2.4 Target Market Segments:** We segment our addressable market into three main categories: **(A) Public Mobile Networks** – the primary market, comprising the national mobile operators’ 5G/6G networks (e.g., China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom). There are millions of base stations in this segment; initially even a small percentage adoption in urban hotspots would yield thousands of deployments. **(B) Vertical Industry Private Networks** – 5G/6G private networks for sectors like energy, manufacturing, transportation, and public safety. These are smaller in scale (hundreds or thousands of sites per network) but often have high willingness-to-pay for reliability and optimization. **(C) Defense and Government Networks** – specialized networks for military, emergency communications, law enforcement, which demand secure and autonomous operation; this is a niche but high-value segment. In our first 5 years, we anticipate most of our revenue from segment (A), as operators trial and adopt our solution in their RAN. In the longer term, segments (B) and (C) could become significant as industry digitalization and government interest in autonomous networks grow, potentially comprising a larger share of our business. Notably, DeepSig’s initial traction was in the defense arena (spectrum sensing for DoD), showing that such specialized needs can drive early adoption. We will keep an opportunistic approach to (B) and (C) while focusing on (A) as the volume driver.

**2.5 Global Momentum & Our Position:** The trend toward AI-native networks is global and accelerating. Telcos worldwide are investing in AI for automation and customer experience—according to industry surveys, over 90% of operators have some AI projects underway, from chatbots to network optimization. In mobile networks, major alliances are forming: e.g., the **AI-RAN Alliance** launched in Feb 2024 brings together giants like AWS, Arm, DeepSig, Ericsson, Microsoft, Nokia, NVIDIA, Samsung, SoftBank, T-Mobile, aiming to improve network efficiency and reduce power through AI in RAN. This shows a broad industry commitment to AI-driven RAN transformation. Our project stands at the forefront of this wave. While currently no single player dominates this nascent field, there is a race to influence future standards and architectures. Our strategy is to seize **first-mover advantage** in the AI control-plane niche, especially in China’s enormous market, and then expand globally. By aligning with national priorities and moving faster than global competitors in demonstrating real-world viability, we aim to establish ourselves as a leader in this space. In the following sections, we elaborate on our technology, products, competitive landscape, and go-to-market, which together demonstrate how we intend to capture this market opportunity.

### 3. Technical Approach & Product Architecture

**3.1 Technical Concept:** Our solution is built on the concept of an **“AI-Native Air Interface”**, meaning AI agents are integrated into the radio protocol stack as a core design element rather than as an add-on tool. In practice, this involves embedding a large Transformer-based model (LLM) inside the gNB (5G base station) control-plane software (specifically within the RRC layer). By doing so, we replace certain fixed state-machine logic with an AI that can interpret network context and make control decisions autonomously. The forthcoming 6G era is expected to adopt AI not just for minor optimizations but as **integral design primitives** of the air interface – our approach is a concrete realization of this vision. The AI agent is fine-tuned on domain-specific data (RRC messaging viewed as a “language”) so that it learns to generate ASN.1-encoded control messages and handle entire procedures (like connection setup, handovers, etc.) through learned behavior. Crucially, while the **internal decision-making becomes AI-driven and dynamic, externally the protocol remains standards-compliant**. In other words, UEs (user devices) and the core network still see normal RRC messages, ensuring compatibility. This strategy of “de-protocolization” refers to breaking free from hard-coded rules internally, while **preserving standard protocol interfaces** externally. It’s a harmonious blend: letting AI flexibly orchestrate control events within the base station, but outputting decisions in a format that legacy components understand, thus making adoption feasible in current networks.

**3.2 System Architecture:** Our system architecture can be described in three layers: **Data Perception, AI Decision, and Execution Control**, spanning from radio hardware up to the network cloud:

* **Data Perception Layer:** This comprises multi-source data collection on both radio and network levels. On the radio side, we tap into real-time low-level information such as channel quality indicators (CQI), random access requests, interference levels, etc., which are normally handled by PHY/MAC/RLC. These are fed upward to the AI agent. Additionally, network-side context (e.g., core network signals like slice configurations, QoS requirements from applications) is also provided to the AI. A key component here is our **Spectrum Sensing Module**, which uses deep learning to analyze raw RF signals and detect various emitters or interference in real-time. This provides environmental awareness akin to DeepSig’s OmniSIG (AI-powered RF situational awareness). All these inputs are preprocessed and formatted as an input state for the AI model, encapsulating both radio environment and service context.
* **AI Decision Layer:** This is the “brain” of the system, located in the gNB’s Central Unit (CU) Control Plane – essentially an **embedded RRC AI agent** (our Large RRC Model). It consists of a specially fine-tuned large Transformer model that combines wireless domain knowledge with sequence decision-making capability. When an uplink event occurs (e.g., a UE sends an RRC request or some network condition changes), the AI model encodes the current context into a prompt and generates the appropriate control response message and actions via autoregressive inference. For example, on receiving a connection request, the model, considering load, channel state, and subscriber profile, might directly output an RRC Connection Setup message with tailored configuration parameters. Or if a UE is moving out of coverage, the model could decide to initiate a handover and craft the necessary command. The model’s output goes through a **Protocol Formatter** module which ensures the message is properly structured (e.g., correct ASN.1 encoding) before passing it on. Notably, the AI can also provide a level of reasoning or confidence with its decisions (some LLMs can produce self-explanations), which can be logged for operators – this feature can increase transparency of AI actions, a critical factor for trust and debugging.
* **Execution Control Layer:** This includes the remaining traditional stack components and our supplementary control logic. Lower layers (RLC, MAC, PHY) receive the AI agent’s decisions (e.g., “allocate these resources to UE X” or “execute handover for UE Y”) and carry them out as usual – scheduling transmissions, configuring PHY accordingly, etc. We introduce a **Policy Arbitration Module** in this layer as a safety guard: if the AI’s output seems anomalous or uncertain, the system can fall back to default rule-based behavior or require confirmation. This prevents any potential AI misbehavior from jeopardizing the network. Essentially, it’s a fail-safe that ensures network stability by providing an override path (similar to autopilot systems with human override in aviation). Additionally, the Execution layer continuously feeds back results and new measurements (post-action outcomes) to the AI Decision layer, closing the control loop. Overall, this architecture – an AI co-processor within the standard base station – allows a **modular upgrade** of existing RANs with intelligence, without altering the external network elements or the UE.

*(Figure 1: System architecture diagram illustrating integration of an AI agent in the 5G gNB control plane and interactions among components.)*

**3.3 Key Technical Modules & Products:**

* **AI Air Interface Control Agent (Large RRC Agent):** This is our flagship product – a software module that runs in the base station’s control-plane (CU-CP) to augment or replace conventional RRC logic. It contains our fine-tuned large model (currently \~8B parameters, potentially scaling to tens of billions) optimized for real-time inference at the network edge. Through techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a custom RRC tokenizer, we’ve achieved a model that “speaks” the RRC protocol with high fidelity. A lightweight inference engine (with GPU/DPU acceleration) is embedded to ensure inference latency of just a few milliseconds, meeting RAN timing requirements. The Large RRC Agent is essentially a **plug-in AI brain** for base stations, which can be deployed as a container or software patch in 5G/6G baseband units. It empowers existing base stations with autonomous decision-making in call admission, radio bearer setup, mobility management, etc. – all while outputting 3GPP-compliant messages.
* **Spectrum Awareness Engine:** This is a complementary module (or separate product) focusing on **AI-powered spectrum sensing and interference detection**. It can be embedded in Open RAN radio units (O-RUs) or run on dedicated monitoring devices. Using deep neural networks (CNNs plus sequential models), it processes wideband RF data to identify signal types and anomalies in real time – detecting unintended interference, jamming attempts, or unauthorized transmissions. By applying this across frequencies, it provides continuous **RF situational awareness** for the network, enhancing security and optimization. This draws on concepts proven by DeepSig’s OmniSIG, which offers best-in-class ML-based spectrum awareness. Our engine integrates with the RAN intelligent controller (RIC) via open APIs, making the RAN **fully spectrum-aware** in an interoperable way. This module feeds valuable environmental info to the AI agent (e.g., “excessive interference on channel X”), and is itself a sellable product for entities that require advanced spectrum monitoring (e.g., regulators or enterprises running private networks).
* **Adaptive RAN Optimization Module:** Housed either in the cloud or an operator’s data center, this module performs continual learning and optimization of network parameters using AI. It includes a **Digital Twin simulator** and an **Online Learning component**. Leveraging the NVIDIA Aerial Omniverse digital twin, we simulate network scenarios (from single cell to full city layouts) to generate training data and evaluate new AI strategies at scale. The online learning component uses real network feedback to fine-tune the AI agent’s behavior (via reinforcement learning or closed-loop adjustments). For instance, it might use multi-arm bandit or deep RL algorithms to refine how the AI agent balances load vs. signal quality for handover decisions, based on long-term reward (KPIs like drop-call rate). This ensures our AI continually **self-optimizes** rather than being a static model. Through this cloud-based module, we can push periodic model updates or parameter tweaks to deployed agents (much like Tesla’s OTA updates for autopilot), thereby improving performance over time. It creates a virtuous cycle: more deployment → more data → better model → improved performance for customers.
* **Cloud Management & Service Platform:** To facilitate customer adoption and use, we provide a cloud portal and backend for managing the AI agents and delivering value-added services. Key features include centralized model management (distribution of model updates, version control), performance monitoring dashboards (visualizing AI decisions, network KPIs), and developer APIs for customization. Customers can log into a web interface to see, for example, how the AI agent is impacting their network metrics or to receive spectrum alerts. Crucially, this platform also acts as a **model hub**: a central repository from which pre-trained models (and any customer-specific fine-tuned models) can be securely accessed and updated. This is akin to DeepSig’s OmniSIG Model Hub, which accelerates user access to the latest AI models. Additionally, the platform can host our simulation environment, allowing operators to test new AI strategies virtually (a “digital twin as a service”). In essence, this cloud service not only supports our licensing model (by enabling subscription offerings), but it also increases customer stickiness by providing continuous improvements and support.

*(Figure 2: Functional modules of the platform and their integration into an operator’s network.)*

**3.4 Technology Maturity & Validation:** We have already achieved key proof-of-concepts critical to de-risking our technology. In the lab, we fine-tuned a large language model (\~8B parameters) on 50k real-world RRC message pairs; this model attained **97% exact field accuracy** in generating RRC messages, an order of magnitude better than a zero-shot baseline. This result, obtained on an edge GPU, is the first known demonstration of LLM-based RRC message orchestration and confirms the feasibility of AI handling protocol tasks. We have also built a **cell-level simulation** with NVIDIA’s digital twin to test the AI agent’s behavior. In a simulated urban macro-cell scenario, our AI agent dynamically adjusted resource allocation and mobility decisions. The simulation indicated \~30% reduction in drop-call rate and \~15% throughput gain versus static algorithms, under varying load and interference conditions (preliminary results). Encouraged by these, our next step (in the next 6–12 months) is to conduct **field trials** in live network environments. We plan to work with an operator’s test network or innovation lab to deploy our AI agent in a small cluster of base stations, to evaluate real-world performance on metrics like connection setup latency, handover success, etc. This pilot deployment – perhaps the first of its kind – will allow us to measure any integration issues and refine our system. It’s important to note that we are taking a cautious, stepwise approach: initially running the AI in a shadow mode or under supervision alongside existing RRC, then gradually increasing its control authority as confidence builds. By the end of these trials, we aim to demonstrate that our AI agent can operate **reliably and beneficially** in a production-like setting. That will mark a key inflection from prototype to product-ready technology.

### 4. Business Model & Revenue Streams

**4.1 Customer Segments:** We target **B2B customers in the telecom domain**, primarily:

* **Mobile Network Operators (MNOs):** The big three in China (and peers globally) who run national 5G/6G networks. They seek solutions to boost network performance and reduce OPEX, making them prime customers for our AI control software.
* **Telecom Equipment Vendors:** Companies like Huawei, ZTE, Ericsson, Nokia, etc., who could integrate our AI modules into their RAN offerings. By licensing our technology, they can enhance their product capabilities (e.g., shipping “AI-enhanced base stations”).
* **Enterprise Private Network Integrators:** System integrators or enterprises setting up private 5G networks for factories, campuses, utilities, etc. They would value our spectrum sensing and adaptive control to optimize their networks.
* **Government and Defense Networks:** Entities running special communication networks (for public safety, military, emergency communications) that require autonomy and reliability; they may procure our solution to upgrade their network intelligence and security.

Given this range, our go-to-market will involve both **direct sales** and **partnerships**. Direct sales will focus on engaging operators and large enterprise customers to deploy our solutions in their networks or testbeds. Partnerships will involve equipment makers – e.g., embedding our software into their base station software stack or offering it as an option to their operator clients (akin to an OEM model). By collaborating with vendors, we can leverage their existing sales channels to scale deployment.

**4.2 Revenue Streams:** We anticipate two primary revenue streams: **software licensing fees** and **cloud subscription fees**.

* **Software Licensing:** We will charge one-time or recurring license fees for the deployment of our AI software modules. This could be structured per network element (e.g., a fee per base station or per RAN node that runs our agent) or tiered by network size (e.g., priced in blocks of X sites). We might offer term-based licenses (annual) to allow recurring revenue. For instance, an operator might pay an annual license fee for each AI agent deployed in its network, or a vendor might pay us a royalty for each unit of their equipment that includes our AI. This is analogous to the traditional telco software model (high-margin license fees). With DeepSig as a reference: they position their AI modules as drop-in RAN component replacements, presumably licensing them to defense or comms customers. Similarly, we intend to license our Large RRC Agent, Spectrum Engine, etc., to B2B clients. For large deals, we may consider enterprise licensing (a flat fee for unlimited internal deployments) to accommodate bigger operator customers. Also, intellectual property licensing is a possibility: if a vendor wants deeper integration, we could license certain patents or know-how under royalty agreements. In summary, software licensing yields **upfront revenue** and leverages the high value-add of our technology.
* **Cloud Service Subscription:** Alongside licenses, we’ll offer ongoing services delivered via our cloud platform on a subscription (SaaS) basis. These include: **regular model updates** (subscribers get access to our continuously improved AI models, e.g., “AI model update service” as an annual subscription), **network digital twin and simulation services** (access to our cloud-based simulation to test network changes in a risk-free environment), **real-time spectrum monitoring and alerting** (if an operator subscribes, they get continuous cloud analysis of their spectrum beyond what on-premises agents do), and **premium support & analytics** (dedicated support, analytics reports, etc.). Customers will pay monthly or annual subscription fees for these cloud offerings. This creates a stable, recurring revenue stream. For example, DeepSig launched its OmniSIG Model Hub to provide central access to AI models – likely on a subscription or usage basis – which is a precedent for our model. We foresee offering, say, a tiered subscription: “Standard” plan includes periodic model updates and basic monitoring, “Premium” adds full digital twin access and advanced analytics. The key point is that after the initial license sale, the cloud subscription keeps us engaged with the customer and generates continuous value (and revenue).

**4.3 Pricing Strategy:** We will adopt a **value-based pricing** strategy, given the potentially game-changing performance improvements our solution offers. Rather than cost-plus, we’ll price our product in line with the tangible benefits delivered. For instance, if our AI yields a 20% capacity uplift or 15% OPEX reduction, we’ll price our solution to share a fraction of that value with the customer (ensuring their ROI is clear). Early on, to encourage adoption, we may use **pilot-friendly pricing** – such as free or nominal-cost trials for a limited period or network scope – to let customers validate the benefits firsthand. Once proven, we would move to full pricing for broader rollouts.

For operator customers, one model could be an annual license fee per base station (or per cell site). For example, if a base station yields, say, \$5,000 in annual savings or added capacity value thanks to our AI, we might charge \~\$1,000 per station per year license. For a large operator with thousands of sites, this adds up but remains justified by savings. Alternatively, we might price by **network size tiers** (e.g., up to 1,000 sites = \$X, up to 10,000 sites = \$Y) for simplicity in contracting.

For cloud services, pricing might be **subscription tiers or usage-based**. E.g., spectrum monitoring service could be priced per MHz-band per month, or model updates per site per year. We will also consider **bundled pricing** – offering an integrated package of on-prem license + cloud services at a higher overall cost but better value than separate.

It’s key to note that our solution, being software, has very high gross margins. Once developed, each additional deployment has low marginal cost, meaning our pricing can create robust profits. We aim to maintain premium pricing reflecting our solution’s mission-critical nature. However, we’ll remain flexible for initial reference customers: for the first few deployments, we might offer significant discounts or even free proof-of-concept to build success cases and trust.

**4.4 Sales & Distribution:** Our sales approach will combine direct engagements and strategic partnerships:

* **Direct Sales:** We will directly approach target customers (especially network operators) through our business development team. This involves presentations to their technology and operations executives, demonstrating lab results, and proposing pilot projects. We anticipate a long sales cycle for operators (could be 6–12 months from initial contact to contract), so we’ll allocate technical sales engineers to work closely on trials, RFIs/RFPs, etc. Early wins might come via operators’ innovation programs or government-sponsored projects (we’re already exploring these avenues in China).
* **Strategic Partnerships:** To scale beyond what a small team can directly sell, we’ll partner with major industry players. This includes equipment manufacturers – e.g., signing agreements where our AI module is integrated into their RAN products or offered as an option. Under such partnerships, we might use an OEM model (they resell our solution, and we get either a license fee or revenue share). Another avenue is collaborating with cloud providers or system integrators (for private networks) to include our solution in their offerings. For instance, working with a cloud operator to host our digital twin service and promote it to their telecom clients.
* **Marketing & Branding:** We will actively build thought leadership by publishing white papers on our pilot outcomes, speaking at industry conferences (MWC, 6G summits, etc.), and highlighting the policy alignment of our work. Being a first-mover, we can shape the narrative and position our company as synonymous with “AI native RAN solution.” We will also emphasize our “China’s own DeepSig” identity domestically, which appeals to national self-reliance sentiments and differentiates us from foreign vendors.
* **Demonstration & Trials:** We consider on-site demos and trials as crucial sales tools. We will maintain a demo setup (e.g., a small portable test network or an arrangement in an operator lab) to showcase live how our AI agent works. Once a pilot is in progress with one customer, we’ll use that site as a reference for others, arranging visits or sharing results (with permission). Because telcos often follow each other’s leads, a successful demonstration in one network greatly eases selling to another.

**4.5 Reference Cases & Benchmarks:** Globally, companies like DeepSig and Cohere have proven the B2B model in our domain. DeepSig, for example, has raised funding and engaged customers by licensing its OmniPHY and OmniSIG software to improve wireless systems, and even secured a US government grant to integrate their spectrum sensing into Open RAN radios. Cohere has collaborated with operators and vendors to deploy its xApp and announced tangible results (doubling spectral efficiency in trials). These cases validate that telecom operators and vendors are willing to adopt third-party AI solutions that demonstrably improve performance.

Our business model learns from these precedents but differentiates in scope: whereas DeepSig began with physical layer and defense clients, we target the broader control-plane transformation for operators; compared to Cohere’s focus on incremental capacity gains in existing networks, we offer a more comprehensive reimagining of RAN control which can unlock new capabilities. This means our **value proposition is broader** (not just efficiency, but also network agility, new features, etc.). We will, however, similarly emphasize a **B2B SaaS+license hybrid**: one-time software deals plus ongoing services.

In summary, our business model is designed to capture immediate value through high-margin software licenses, while building a recurring revenue base via cloud services. This ensures early cash-flow as well as long-term sustainability. As deployments increase, economies of scale and upsell opportunities (like more advanced model packages) will further boost our financial performance. We will continuously refine the model in response to market feedback, but the dual revenue stream approach provides resilience and ample upside as we grow.

### 5. Market Analysis & TAM Estimation

**5.1 Market Size Overview:** The market for AI-enabled wireless networks is at a nascent but rapidly expanding stage, with vast potential. According to Precedence Research, the global **AI in telecommunications** market is projected to reach around **\$14.99 billion by 2030**, growing at a CAGR of \~40.2% from 2022. This underscores the massive opportunity and the critical importance telcos place on AI to stay competitive. Key growth drivers include the need for efficient network management, improved customer experience, and the rising adoption of AI across telco operations. Asia, and China in particular, will account for a large slice of this pie due to the region’s sheer telecom scale and proactive adoption of new tech. Given China’s dominance in 5G deployment (as of mid-2023, it had over 70% of the world’s 5G base stations), we estimate China’s telecom AI market could reach tens of billions of RMB by 2030, possibly \~30-40% of the global total.

Within this broad market, our focus can be considered a sub-segment: **AI for RAN (Radio Access Network)**, particularly AI for RAN control and optimization. The RAN accounts for a major portion of network capex and opex. Operators worldwide invest billions annually in RAN hardware; if AI can optimize how that hardware is used, it represents a multi-billion dollar value lever. For instance, even a 5-10% improvement in spectral efficiency or network utilization can translate to significant opex savings (fewer sites needed for same capacity, or deferred capex for expansion). We anticipate that by 2028, spending on RAN-specific AI solutions (including products like AI-driven RIC apps, automated optimization tools, etc.) will reach on the order of \$2-5 billion globally (our estimate), making it one of the fastest growing slices of the telco AI market.

*(Figure 3: Number of 5G Base Stations in China, 2019–2023)*

The figure above shows the explosive growth of 5G infrastructure in China, rising from \~0.13 million sites in 2019 to **3.38 million in 2023**. This scale highlights a critical fact: current manual and static optimization methods cannot cope with such complexity, creating a fertile ground for AI-driven solutions. Each base station is a potential deployment for our AI agent. By addressing even a fraction of this installed base, the revenue opportunity is enormous.

To illustrate TAM with a simplified scenario: suppose by 2030 China has 5 million 5G/6G base stations (public + private). If we managed to deploy our solution in just 10% of them (500k sites), and charged an average of ¥10,000 (\$1.5k) per site annually (a conservative figure relative to value provided), that’s ¥5 billion (\$750 million) annual revenue potential in China alone. Globally, the number of macro and small cells will be even higher (especially with 6G and new cell types), so the worldwide TAM for an AI base station agent could be several times that.

**5.2 Target Market Segmentation:** Our addressable market can be broken down into:

* **Public Mobile Networks (Operators):** The largest segment by volume. China’s big three operators together have \~2.3 million 5G base stations by end of 2022, projected to approach \~3 million by end of 2023 (actually exceeded as we saw). Globally, dozens of operators are rolling out 5G and soon 6G. This segment offers high volume but requires lengthy sales and strict reliability. We plan to capture a significant share of this in China (aiming for at least one major operator as a core client in initial years) and gradually expand to select global operators, perhaps via partnerships.
* **Vertical Industry Networks:** These include private 5G networks for manufacturing plants, mines, ports, campuses, etc. In China, there were already over 10,000 5G industry application projects by 2023. While each deployment is smaller (maybe tens or hundreds of base stations), the customers often demand high reliability and customization, which align with our value proposition of enhanced control and sensing. This market will grow as 5G/6G penetrates industries (the Industrial Internet). We anticipate initial projects in this segment for us might involve things like a smart factory network wanting AI-based interference avoidance or a power grid network needing autonomous control.
* **Government & Defense Networks:** Though not as large in number, these are willing to invest in cutting-edge tech for secure, autonomous operations (for instance, military communications or emergency networks in remote areas). Our AI solution can appeal here by offering autonomy (e.g., an isolated network that self-optimizes without constant human oversight). We consider this a secondary market that could bring lucrative contracts, especially if we obtain certain security clearances or endorsements.

In the first 3 years, we expect nearly all our revenue to come from operators (public networks) as they’ll be the first to trial and deploy at any scale. By year 5 and beyond, as our product matures and gains reputation, we foresee more traction in verticals and government networks, which could account for perhaps 20-30% of our revenues at that time.

**5.3 Competitive Landscape & Market Share:** The competitive environment is currently in flux (detailed in Section 6). No company has locked in a dominant position yet in AI-native RAN control, but players like DeepSig, Cohere, and big vendors are active. Our goal is to capture a leadership position in China (where we have a home advantage) and a meaningful presence globally through differentiation.

We internally target achieving over **50% share** of the China market for AI air-interface solutions (since we might initially be one of few domestic options) and perhaps around **10% of the global market** in our niche by the end of the decade. While percentages sound abstract, in concrete terms this might mean: by year 5, having our AI deployed in, say, 1,000+ sites in China (which might be 0.2% of China’s base stations) and some tens or hundreds of sites abroad. By year 10 (post-2030), if 6G adopts AI widely, we’d aim for our technology (or derivatives) to be present in a significant fraction of networks.

It’s important to note that capturing even a single-digit percentage of the RAN AI market could translate into a very large business. Telecom is a domain of huge numbers, and being a successful vendor for even one major operator’s network can be extremely profitable.

**5.4 Growth Drivers:** Several factors will drive market growth in our favor:

* **Operator Cost Pressure:** Global telcos are under pressure to reduce costs as revenue per bit declines. Automation via AI is one of the few levers left to meaningfully cut OPEX (e.g., optimize energy usage, reduce labor in operations) and CAPEX (by improving network utilization). This economic incentive will push them to adopt AI solutions that prove effective.
* **6G on the Horizon:** With 6G standardization starting around 2025 and commercialization around 2030, the industry is in a phase of exploration and investment in new tech. Operators are more open to try radical ideas now to shape 6G. Our solution can be part of their 6G trials, giving us market entry.
* **Open RAN Movement:** The industry shift toward Open RAN disaggregated networks (encouraged by many governments) creates opportunities for new software entrants like us. Open RAN specifically calls for a RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) with xApps/rApps – an architecture designed for AI/ML algorithms to plug in. This aligns perfectly with our offering. As Open RAN deployments increase (Omdia forecasts significant growth by mid/late 2020s), our addressable market within those networks grows. Traditional vendor-integrated networks are harder to penetrate, but Open RAN lowers the barrier.
* **Government Support and Mandates:** In China, the government’s support for domestic innovation could indirectly boost adoption. For instance, if our solution is seen as advancing China’s 6G leadership, we might get endorsements that encourage operators to implement it. Additionally, security regulations might prefer domestic AI solutions over foreign, giving us an edge at home.
* **Competitive Necessity:** Once one major operator demonstrates significant gains using AI in their network, others will likely follow to avoid falling behind. We may see a domino effect – e.g., if we help one operator reduce call drops or power consumption notably, rival operators will feel pressure to match that via similar AI capabilities. This competitive drive can accelerate market adoption industry-wide.

**5.5 Market Entry Strategy:** Our initial market entry is focused on **China’s mobile operators**, where we have strategic advantages and immediate access. We will leverage local success to build credibility, then expand internationally in a staged manner. For global expansion, we will likely target markets that are innovation-friendly or have Open RAN initiatives (e.g., Japan, parts of Europe, Middle East). We may partner with local integrators or use the connections from the AI-RAN Alliance to reach these markets.

In summary, the TAM for our solution is very large and growing, but actual capture will depend on execution and proving value. Our plan is to methodically convert small wins (pilots, initial contracts) into broader deployments, steadily increasing our share of this burgeoning market. Given favorable industry trends and our head start in technology, we are optimistic about achieving a strong position in this multi-billion dollar opportunity.

### 6. Competitive Landscape and Analysis

Our venture operates at the intersection of wireless communications and AI, an emerging field where competition is just beginning to take shape. We categorize our competition into three groups: (1) Innovative startups (like DeepSig and Cohere) working on AI for wireless; (2) Established telecom vendors (e.g., Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia) who are adding AI features internally; (3) Platform and ecosystem players (e.g., NVIDIA and industry alliances). Below we analyze key players and how we compare:

**6.1 DeepSig (USA)** – *Pioneer in AI-Native Wireless*. DeepSig is a US-based startup (founded 2016 in Arlington, VA) that has been a trailblazer in applying deep learning to wireless communications. Their focus has been on the physical layer and signal intelligence. DeepSig’s **OmniPHY®** product leverages AI to replace certain traditional signal processing components to improve capacity, coverage, cost and energy efficiency of wireless systems, essentially an AI-native PHY that can adapt and “learn” the best performance. They also offer **OmniSIG®**, an ML software for RF spectrum situational awareness, capable of detecting, classifying, and localizing signals in real time – used for battlefield awareness, drone detection, interference monitoring, etc. DeepSig’s approach is largely **bottom-up** in the stack: using neural networks to enhance physical layer and spectrum sensing capabilities. Their business model is B2B licensing; they work with defense and commercial partners, integrating their software into radio systems. They secured a notable NTIA grant in 2025 to embed their spectrum sensing into production Open RAN radios, validating both their tech and their collaborative approach with industry.

**Comparison:** DeepSig demonstrates that AI can indeed be injected into wireless systems to achieve gains (they recently showcased an AI-native 6G air interface demo using NVIDIA’s platform at MWC 2025). However, DeepSig’s focus has been narrower (PHY layer enhancement and sensing) and they have primarily targeted U.S. defense and maybe some telco projects. They have not, to public knowledge, tackled full control-plane protocol replacement with AI – which is our unique angle. Our **strengths relative to DeepSig**: We have a head start on control-plane AI and a deep understanding of RRC/state machine intricacies which they may not have. Also, being a Chinese entity gives us easier access to the China market, whereas DeepSig (a U.S. company with likely U.S. govt ties) would face barriers selling to Chinese operators. Conversely, DeepSig’s advantages include a few years head-start in business development, existing funding (\$5M Series A in 2020, possibly more since) and products in field trials; plus their team (co-founders from Virginia Tech) is strong. We consider DeepSig more of a **benchmark and potential collaborator** than direct adversary in our initial market. There’s even potential to partner – e.g., combining their AI PHY with our AI RRC to offer an end-to-end AI-driven stack, especially in markets where both can operate (some alliance or tech integration could be beneficial). But in markets like the US, they would be a competitor if we ever go there. In sum, DeepSig’s presence validates our space and we will strive to outpace them in control-plane AI, while learning from their path in commercialization.

**6.2 Cohere Technologies (USA)** – *Spectrum Multiplier for 4G/5G*. Cohere, based in Silicon Valley, takes a different approach: rather than redesign protocols, they use advanced algorithms to significantly boost performance of existing 4G/5G networks. Their flagship solution is the **Universal Spectrum Multiplier (USM)**, a software platform (deployed as an Open RAN xApp) that uses sophisticated Delay-Doppler channel models and dynamic pairing/precoding to enable multiple users to share the same time-frequency resources – effectively doubling spectral efficiency in many cases. Cohere’s xApp runs in the near-real-time RIC and works with off-the-shelf base stations, requiring no handset changes. They’ve demonstrated impressive results: e.g., in a Deutsche Telekom O-RAN showcase, USM achieved 2x spectrum and capacity increase with no changes to devices or radios; similarly, a trial with Vodafone and partners in 2021 showed 2x spectral efficiency improvements across an open RAN multi-vendor environment. Cohere’s approach is effectively a drop-in **optimization layer** for current networks – heavily based on unique math (OTFS, Delay-Doppler theory) and machine learning, but focused on enhancing the PHY/MAC scheduling of existing protocols.

**Comparison:** Cohere positions itself as a quick win for operators to get more out of their spectrum (“2x capacity with a software upgrade” is a compelling pitch). It’s more evolutionary than revolutionary, whereas our approach is more revolutionary (re-thinking how the protocol logic works). Cohere’s advantages: they address an immediate pain point (spectral efficiency) with a tangible solution, and they’ve garnered support from big names (collaborations with VMware, Intel, Mavenir, trials with Tier-1 operators). They likely have significant funding and a seasoned CEO (Ray Dolan). For us, Cohere is not a direct competitor in terms of product offering, but they compete in the broader sense of operator attention and budgets for network AI solutions. An operator might ask: should I invest in Cohere’s solution that gives me 50% more capacity now, or in an AI RRC solution that promises bigger autonomy gains long-term but is less proven?

Our differentiation: we offer a **future-oriented paradigm shift** that can unlock new capabilities (self-optimizing networks, reduced complexity, new services), not just optimize current KPIs. Also, Cohere’s solution is somewhat bounded – it improves the physical layer but doesn’t address issues like signaling overload, procedural latency, etc., which our solution does. On the downside, Cohere’s solution might be easier to adopt because it doesn’t require major changes, whereas ours, at least eventually, implies a new architecture.

In strategy, we will emphasize that our solution and Cohere’s are not mutually exclusive – in fact, they could potentially complement each other (e.g., an operator could use Cohere’s USM for immediate gains, and our AI agent for control-plane intelligence). But in any case, Cohere’s progress shows operators are willing to consider third-party AI apps in their RAN (the fact that an external xApp was trialed by DT and Vodafone is encouraging for us). We’ll monitor Cohere’s market traction; if they secure many deployments, it indicates operators’ openness to AI/ML in RAN, which indirectly helps make our case easier, albeit with a different solution.

**6.3 Traditional Telecom Vendors (Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, ZTE)** – *Incumbents with AI initiatives*. The big RAN vendors are not standing still; they each have programs to incorporate AI into their product lines. For example, Huawei has touted concepts like ADN (Autonomous Driving Network) for self-optimizing networks, and has substantial internal R\&D on network AI and 6G (including likely research on AI for protocol stack, though specifics aren’t public). Ericsson has the **OSS/ENM** and machine learning for network optimization and is part of the AI-RAN Alliance, indicating they see AI-driven RAN automation as pivotal. Nokia has its **Machine Learning-based SON** solutions and is also deeply involved in 6G AI research, with public statements about AI’s huge impact and a collaborative approach needed.

**Comparison:** These giants have enormous resources, existing customer relationships, and control of the network equipment. If any one of them develops an internal solution similar to ours, they could deploy it at scale through their installed base. However, historically, incumbents often integrate new tech slower; they tend to roll out incremental features that fit within their product roadmap (like improved SON, predictive maintenance, etc.) rather than radical changes that could disrupt their own products. Also, they sometimes prefer to see smaller players prove out novel concepts and then either partner, acquire, or replicate if needed.

Our strategy with incumbents is more **coopetition**: we want to collaborate rather than head-on compete where possible. For instance, we can offer our solution to vendors to enhance their offerings (like licensing to them or co-developing for their architecture). It might be easier for them to adopt our specialized tech than to build in-house from scratch if we are ahead. Already we see open attitudes: Ericsson’s statement in the AI-RAN Alliance explicitly calls out working together across operators, vendors, etc., to leverage relevant data and enable AI use cases. This bodes well for partnerships.

Nevertheless, there’s a risk: if our approach gains traction or becomes a candidate for 6G standard, big vendors could allocate significant resources to develop similar AI agents (especially companies like Huawei which has a massive 6G research budget). They could also use their influence in standards bodies to steer things. To mitigate that, we will aggressively patent our techniques and aim to be part of the standardization process so our solutions (or at least our expertise) shape the outcomes. If we succeed and a vendor sees us as an attractive asset, one **exit strategy** is acquisition by a vendor – turning a potential competitor into our buyer.

In the Chinese market specifically, Huawei and ZTE loom large. Huawei has its own end-to-end solutions and might be reluctant initially to adopt an external startup’s tech, but if the government nudges for indigenous innovation and if we demonstrate clear value, they might collaborate or form some joint effort (especially if political pressure to reduce reliance on US tech indirectly benefits domestic startups like us). We will maintain dialogue with these vendors’ research arms, pitch the complementarity of our solution (e.g., it could make their equipment more attractive if included).

**6.4 NVIDIA & AI-RAN Alliance** – *Ecosystem Catalysts*. NVIDIA is not a direct competitor providing the same product, but it is an enabler and potentially an influencer in the ecosystem. NVIDIA’s **Aerial platform** and **Omniverse Digital Twin** have become key development tools for AI in 5G/6G. By providing GPU-accelerated PHY and a physics-based simulation environment, NVIDIA allows companies like ours to develop and test AI algorithms far more easily. Additionally, through initiatives like the AI-RAN Alliance, NVIDIA and partners are shaping the narrative around AI in RAN and pushing for cross-industry collaboration.

For us, NVIDIA is more friend than foe: we rely on their platform to speed up our R\&D (e.g., using their Aerial SDK and possibly their pretrained models, etc.). Our demonstration at MWC (if any) or results often involve NVIDIA’s tech under the hood, which is fine. NVIDIA’s interest is to sell more GPUs and see AI adoption in wireless (which would drive demand for their chips). They likely won’t release an “AI RRC product” themselves – instead, they support others to do so. That being said, one must consider that large tech companies (like potentially Google, Microsoft, etc. in future) could eye the network AI space if it becomes heavily software-centric. But currently, NVIDIA’s stance is to power the ecosystem.

We will actively participate in the ecosystem efforts. By being in the same alliance or developer programs, we raise our profile and can collaborate with other members (some of which, like Ericsson, Nokia, operators, we want to influence as potential customers or partners). The **AI-RAN Alliance** brings together not just vendors but also cloud and academic players, which can set research agendas and even early standards. We saw in supporting quotes from alliance members statements like *“AI will fundamentally change wireless deployment and enable broad innovation”*, which validates our vision, and *“we’re really at the beginning of a long journey... imperative we work together to combine expertise”* – indicating big players know collaboration is needed.

In summary, NVIDIA and the alliance represent the **ecosystem momentum** behind what we do. They’re helping evangelize AI in RAN and providing tools, which indirectly benefits us by expanding our potential customer readiness. We will maintain a strong relationship with platform providers, possibly co-marketing our successes (NVIDIA often highlights success stories using their tech, which could give us exposure, e.g., a blog about DeepSig’s or others’ demos – we’d aim for similar).

**6.5 Other Startups / Labs:** Aside from DeepSig and Cohere, there are other smaller or research projects (like academic spin-offs, etc.) possibly working on related concepts (e.g., we know of some European research on AI for protocol, and Chinese universities exploring “network GPT”). At this time, none are clearly ahead of us in our specific area, but we keep an eye on entities like:

* **Academic teams**: e.g., in China, universities such as Tsinghua, BUPT, etc., have research on big models for networks (we have one such professor as our advisor). These could form future startups or license tech.
* **Global tech companies**: Google and Microsoft have general AI capabilities; Google has a 5G small cell project (Google Evenstar) and could theoretically apply AI at some point; Microsoft (through Azure for Operators) is working on telecom cloud and might integrate AI (they’re in the alliance too).
* **OSS/Community**: There are open projects like O-RAN OSC and others; perhaps someone might contribute AI xApps to open RAN community.

Our proactive steps include forging relationships or at least awareness with top academic groups (to possibly hire talent or co-develop), and ensuring we collaborate with standard bodies to not be blindsided by a hidden competitor’s contribution.

**6.6 Our Competitive Strategy:** Given this landscape, our strategy is:

* **Differentiate with Innovation:** Focus on our unique angle (LLM in control-plane) and keep extending that lead (e.g., extending to multi-domain like core network control, cross-layer optimization, etc.). By the time others realize this is feasible and valuable, we intend to have robust solutions and real-world data that’s hard to replicate.
* **Lock-in via IP and Data:** Build a strong IP portfolio around our techniques, and accumulate proprietary data (from simulations, trials) to train our models – this data advantage can be a moat since replicating large, real dataset training is non-trivial.
* **Collaborate and Influence:** Turn potential competitors into partners whenever possible. For instance, rather than directly competing with a vendor’s own limited SON feature, show them that partnering with us yields a better combined result for the operator. Through alliances and co-development, we aim to make our solution a de facto choice for AI in RAN, so even if competition arises, we are the reference implementation.
* **First-mover Market Capture:** Particularly in China, we have a home turf advantage. We will double down here to secure key customers early (like a large operator pilot success). Success in China’s scale is a powerful validation we can later leverage internationally. It also helps financially to survive competition (revenue from Chinese contracts can fund global expansion).
* **Agility over Giants:** As a startup, we can iterate faster than large corporations. We adopt a high-velocity development and deployment approach, continuously improving our product. If an incumbent wants 2 years to develop a similar feature, we’ll have done two new versions by then. This agility is an edge as long as we keep it.
* **Quality and Reliability:** In telecom, incumbents have trust. We must demonstrate carrier-grade reliability to overcome the “no one got fired for buying Ericsson” mindset. That means rigorous testing, and possibly partnering with trusted integrators to deploy, so that we meet the five-nines expectations. If we match or exceed incumbents on quality, our innovation will shine.

In conclusion, while we face emerging competition, we are well positioned as a trailblazer in AI-native RAN control, especially within China. By leveraging our technical head start, local advantages, and a collaborative mindset, we aim to carve out and maintain a leading market position. The next sections will detail how we execute to realize this potential and mitigate competitive risks through strategic action.

### 7. Go-to-Market Strategy & Execution Roadmap

Translating our innovative technology into commercial success requires a clear execution plan. We outline below our phased strategy over the next five years, including pilot deployments, partnerships, scaling steps, and key milestones.

**7.1 Phased Implementation Plan:**

* **Phase 1 – R\&D Validation (2025):** *Objective:* Build a working prototype and secure initial pilot opportunities. In the first 6–12 months post-funding, we will focus on completing the core AI agent development and internal testing. Using the NVIDIA Aerial digital twin, we’ll simulate realistic scenarios to refine our model’s performance. Concurrently, we will engage in **operator lab trials**: we’re in discussions with a research arm of a major operator to deploy our prototype in their test lab environment. Achieving lab validation will be a crucial credibility builder. By Q4 2025, we aim to sign our first **field trial** agreement – selecting a friendly customer (e.g., a provincial subsidiary of an operator or a state-owned enterprise with a 5G private network) to run a controlled pilot. This Phase 1 pilot might involve equipping, say, 5–10 base stations with our AI agent running in parallel (or in shadow mode initially) and gathering performance data. The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end function in a real network setting and collect data to prove our KPIs (like faster call setup, fewer drops, etc.) in the wild.
* **Phase 2 – Pilot Expansion (2026–2027):** *Objective:* Achieve successful pilot outcomes, and convert them into initial commercial contracts. In 2026, based on positive results from Phase 1, we will broaden our pilot deployments. This includes testing our system in **multiple scenarios**: for example, one in an urban macro network (to show capacity and mobility handling) and one in an indoor or enterprise network (to show versatility). We also plan to initiate a **vendor partnership pilot** – for instance, working with a domestic equipment vendor to integrate our AI agent in one of their open RAN base stations for a trial. Doing so not only proves interoperability with vendor gear but can lay groundwork for co-selling. Throughout these pilots, we will document improvements (quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback). By mid to late 2027, our aim is to secure the first **commercial agreement**. This could be a small-scale deployment contract with an operator (e.g., covering a city cluster or a set number of sites in their live network for year-round use) or supplying an industrial client’s private network with our solution under a paid deal. Achieving initial revenue by 2027 validates our business model and provides case studies. Phase 2 will also involve scaling up our deployment support capability – training a technical support team and establishing processes to install and maintain our solution at customer sites.
* **Phase 3 – Commercial Scale-Up (2028–2029):** *Objective:* Scale deployments, build market leadership, and integrate into 6G ecosystem. By 2028, assuming earlier phases went well, we will push for **wider commercial rollouts**. With a stable v1.x product, we’ll target expansion within existing customer networks (e.g., moving from a single province trial to multi-province deployment for a Chinese operator). Simultaneously, we’ll pursue additional operator customers – leveraging the demonstrable success to win RFPs or direct contracts. We project that by 2028 we could see contracts that cover perhaps 1000+ site deployments. In this phase, we also aim to become part of the **6G standardization efforts**: around 2025–2026, 6G study items will ramp up in 3GPP, and by 2028 Release 21 spec drafting will be ongoing. We intend to contribute to these processes – possibly through operator partners or as observers – to ensure AI-native design (like our approach) is considered. We may publish a white paper or join the IMT-2030 Promotion Group’s projects to shape thinking. By 2029, our vision is to be recognized as a **leading solution provider** in intelligent RAN. We aim to have at least one major Chinese operator as a long-term customer and to have engaged some initial international clients (maybe through partnership deals in a couple of other countries). Commercially, by end of Phase 3 we should have solid revenue streams, positive references, and potentially be gearing up for IPO or strategic investments. Importantly, we will also prepare for the 6G commercial era: having our technology proven in 5G will position us to be part of early 6G rollouts (where AI-based RAN could be a default feature).

**7.2 Go-to-Market Tactics:**

* **Use of Demo/Trial as Sales Catalyst:** In telecom, seeing is believing. We rely on **pilot trials** as a core tactic to convince conservative customers. Our plan is to offer low-risk trial arrangements: we handle the setup (possibly for free or minimal cost in early cases) and demonstrate improvements in their own network. Once results are shown and internal champions at the customer are convinced, the sale of a larger deployment becomes much easier. We will reference each success to pitch to other customers – e.g., if we improved metrics by X% in Operator A’s province, we’ll use that data (with permission) when approaching Operator B or another province of A.
* **Government and Regulatory Alignment:** We will work closely with governmental programs to facilitate deployments. For instance, if the MIIT or local governments set up **6G pilot zones** or “smart network” testbeds, we will aim to get involved. Such involvement not only gives us test opportunities but also stamps an official endorsement on our solution, easing regulatory concerns. We’ll also invite regulators to observe our trials, especially to show how our AI maintains compliance (this pre-empts any regulatory pushback about AI making networks uncontrollable).
* **Partner Leverage:** As mentioned, strategic alliances are key. We will leverage **existing ecosystem players** to amplify reach – e.g., joining an operator’s vendor list via an established SI. For private networks, we might partner with a leading industrial automation firm or telco integrator to include our solution in their offering for, say, a smart factory project. This helps us overcome any sales channel limitations.
* **Phased Contracting:** To reduce customer hesitation, we can structure commercial engagements in phases. For example, an operator contract could be structured as: Phase 1 – deploy in 100 sites for 6 months, with an option to expand to 1000 sites at predetermined terms if KPIs are met. This way, the customer feels protected and we get a clear path to scale if we perform. It is essentially upselling built into the agreement.
* **Marketing & PR:** We will carefully craft our narrative. Early on, we focus on technical credibility (present results at technical forums, publish joint case study with first customer). As we approach broader commercialization (Phase 3), we’ll ramp up marketing – speaking slots at major industry events (MWC Shanghai/Barcelona), press releases on any notable partnership (e.g., if collaborating with a vendor or if a government grant is awarded), and perhaps awards (applying for industry innovation awards). These create buzz and validate that we’re the real deal.
* **Localization for International Markets:** When venturing outside China, we will adapt to local contexts. For example, in Europe or Japan, emphasize how our solution can integrate with local vendors or align with local open RAN initiatives (like those funded by governments there). Possibly hire local bizdev consultants. However, we’ll likely do this only after solidifying domestic base (to avoid stretching too thin).

**7.3 Government Collaboration & Execution Path:** Given the unique role of government in telecom (especially in China), our strategy deeply involves government relations:

* We intend to obtain government support such as **innovation grants** (e.g., apply to National Science and Technology projects or local High-Tech funding). Not only does this provide non-dilutive funds, but government-backed projects often involve trial deployments within state-run carriers.
* We will align our execution with national timelines: for instance, China’s goal to **commercialize 6G by 2030** means significant testing by 2025–2028. We want to be present in those tests. So our Phase 2 and 3 align with that – pushing into the major trials likely to happen in 2026–2028.
* We will also proactively address regulatory needs: for example, obtaining certifications for our software (security clearances, etc.) as needed and working with standard bodies (like CCSA in China, ETSI etc. internationally) to maybe pre-standardize aspects of AI control.

**7.4 Risk Mitigation in Execution:** We acknowledge that executing such an ambitious plan carries risks (which we detail in the Risk section). Key mitigations we are doing:

* For integration risk, we are using **open standards (O-RAN)** and ensuring our solution can coexist with legacy protocols before switching them off. This smooths the adoption.
* To avoid over-extending, we are focusing on a few key pilots rather than many simultaneous ones. It’s better to make two pilots wildly successful than do five mediocrely. This focus ensures quality outcome that we can leverage to get more business.
* We will maintain financial discipline so that Phase 1 and 2 are achievable with seed/A funds – ensuring we don’t rely on large revenue until Phase 3 (as per our financial model).
* We will recruit savvy deployment engineers early (in Phase 2) – telecom deployment has many practical quirks (site access, interoperability issues), so having experienced telecom project managers will keep our pilots on track and on schedule, preserving customer goodwill.

**7.5 Key Milestones & Timeline:**

* *2025 (Year 1):* Prototype ready; lab trial completed demonstrating basic functionality; secure at least one MoU for field trial with an operator or enterprise; Seed funding in place.
* *2026 (Year 2):* Conduct first field trial and publish results; refine product to v1.0; obtain first paying customer (maybe small scale); Series A funding secured to fuel growth.
* *2027 (Year 3):* Achieve commercial contract with a major customer (transition from trial to paid deployment); product proven in multi-scenario; net income breakeven (per financials); recognized in industry (e.g., invited to 3GPP study or won an industry award for innovation).
* *2028 (Year 4):* Scale deployments to >1000 base stations cumulatively; sign partnership with at least one equipment vendor for integration; actively contributing to 6G standard drafts; revenue in tens of millions RMB.
* *2029 (Year 5):* Multi-province or multi-operator deployments ongoing; considering IPO or strategic M\&A offers; widely recognized as leader in AI RAN (perhaps cited in industry reports as such); product roadmap extended to new domains (like core network AI, etc., showing expansion potential).

By hitting these milestones, we ensure that we are not just executing a technology project but building a **commercial enterprise** with growing revenue, customer base, and industry influence. Each milestone de-risks some aspect of the business (technology risk by 2025, customer adoption risk by 2027, scaling risk by 2028, etc.), paving the way for long-term success.

### 8. Core Team & Human Resources Plan

**8.1 Core Team Composition:** Our founding and leadership team brings together deep expertise in wireless communications, AI, and business, which is critical for such an interdisciplinary venture. Key members include:

* **Dr. Zhang $Name Placeholder$ – CEO & Co-founder:** PhD in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University and a PhD (dual) in Communications from the University of Sheffield, UK. He is an expert in 6G network architecture and machine learning, with multiple published papers on AI-driven RAN (including the first end-to-end LLM RRC demo). Dr. Zhang interned at Nokia Bell Labs (France) and has experience bridging research and industry. As CEO, he oversees company strategy, product vision, and is our primary interface to customers and investors.
* **Dr. Li $Name Placeholder$ – CTO & Co-founder:** PhD in Communications from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). He interned at Google AI during his doctoral studies, working on reinforcement learning algorithms. Dr. Li has deep knowledge of wireless protocols and AI, having participated in operator-led network AI projects. As CTO, he leads the technical roadmap and heads the R\&D team, integrating cutting-edge AI techniques with telecom-grade software development.
* **Prof. Wang $Name Placeholder$ – Chief Scientist (Part-time Co-founder):** A tenured professor (and our mentor) at a leading university (expert in wireless networks and AI with 20+ years experience). He has led major national research projects and published extensively on cognitive radios and network AI. Prof. Wang advises us on technical strategy and innovation, ensuring we stay at the forefront of research. He also leverages his academic network to help recruit top talent and validate our approaches.
* **Ms. Chen $Name Placeholder$ – VP of Engineering:** Over 10 years in telecom software engineering; formerly a senior RAN software architect at Huawei. She has led base station software development teams and is intimately familiar with 3GPP protocol implementation and large-scale software systems. Ms. Chen manages the engineering execution – from coding practices to integration testing – ensuring our product meets carrier-grade quality standards and can interface with existing network elements smoothly.

*(Other team member roles abbreviated for brevity – e.g., Head of Product/Marketing if any, Advisors.)*

Our current core team is small (5 key people, including above), but it is highly capable: we cover necessary domains (AI, wireless, software, industry know-how). Each member is hand-picked for complementary skills, and several have **overseas experience** and strong academic credentials, which gives us a global perspective and credibility. For instance, two co-founders have studied or worked abroad, bringing diverse innovation exposure, and others have extensive industry backgrounds at top telecom companies.

**8.2 Team Strengths & Experience:**

* **Domain Expertise:** The team boasts a rare combination of deep AI expertise (large-scale ML, reinforcement learning) and practical wireless engineering. For example, the CTO can fine-tune an LLM and also debug a MAC scheduler – this crossover ability underpins our tech innovation.
* **Proven Innovation Track Record:** Team members have tangible achievements – e.g., Dr. Zhang’s group was the first to have an LLM generate ASN.1 RRC messages, demonstrating our team’s pioneering spirit. Patents and publications by the team validate our thought leadership.
* **Industry Connections:** Through prior internships and work, our members are plugged into key organizations (Nokia Bell Labs, Google, Huawei, etc.). These networks help with partnerships, recruiting, and understanding customer needs. For instance, our CEO’s connections at Nokia or operator labs can open collaboration doors.
* **Global Outlook:** With team members having studied/worked in Europe and the US, and others deeply networked in China, we combine the best of both worlds – cutting-edge Western research insights with on-the-ground knowledge of the Chinese market and execution environment.

**8.3 Hiring Plan:** To execute our roadmap, we plan to systematically grow our team:

* **Current Stage (2025, \~5 staff):** At inception, we have 5 full-time core members (the co-founders and a couple of early engineers). This is sufficient for prototype development. We also have part-time interns from partner universities assisting with data preparation and testing.
* **Next 12 Months:** We plan to expand to \~10–12 full-time employees by end of 2025. Key hires will include:

  * 2–3 **AI Research/ML Engineers**: to work on model training, dataset curation, and algorithmic improvements (pref. with experience in NLP or reinforcement learning).
  * 2 **Wireless System Engineers**: to implement protocol interfaces, ensure our AI outputs integrate correctly with 5G gNB software, and handle testbed setup.
  * 1 **DevOps/Integration Engineer**: to set up continuous integration and manage our simulation/digital twin environment and deployment pipelines.
  * 1 **Testing/QA Engineer**: as we head into field trials, someone dedicated to building test cases, running regression tests, and validating performance in lab conditions is vital.
* **Organizational Structure:** As we hit \~15 people, we’ll form sub-teams. Likely an “AI/Algorithm Team” and a “Systems/Integration Team,” each led by a co-founder or senior engineer, with a project manager coordinating pilot deployment tasks.
* **2026–2027 Expansion:** Assuming successful funding and product traction, by end of 2027 we might grow to \~30–40 employees. New additions will cover:

  * **Customer Support & Deployment Team:** perhaps 5–6 engineers who can be on-site for deployments, handle customer configurations, and provide technical support (with telecom backgrounds).
  * **Cloud Services Team:** 3–4 engineers focusing on our cloud platform, data pipeline (telemetry collection from deployed agents, etc.), and UI/dashboard development.
  * **Product Management & Marketing:** hire 1–2 product managers to define requirements and roadmaps, and a marketing specialist to drive promotions and manage relationships (especially as we begin sales to more customers).
  * **Business Development:** bring on 1–2 bizdev or sales professionals with strong telco contacts (one focusing on domestic carriers, one maybe looking at vertical markets or overseas partnerships).
  * **Admin/Operations:** a finance & HR person to manage growing operational needs, and possibly an office manager.
* **Beyond 2027 (Scaling Stage):** If in Phase 3 we are scaling globally, headcount might exceed 50–60 by 2029. At that point:

  * We’d likely establish **regional teams** (e.g., a small presence in Europe or Southeast Asia for support).
  * More specialized roles like a Chief Security Officer (ensuring our solutions meet all security requirements), and a dedicated standards liaison might appear.

**8.4 Talent Retention & Culture:** We recognize that our industry is talent-driven. Our retention strategy includes:

* **Equity Incentives:** We have set aside \~15% of shares as an employee stock option pool. Early hires receive meaningful stock options, aligning their success with company success. This is crucial especially given bigger companies might lure with high salaries; we offer ownership and growth potential as a counter.
* **Innovative Culture:** We foster a research-driven, open culture where new ideas are encouraged and every engineer can propose improvements. Publishing and attending conferences is encouraged (we might sponsor key employees to go to academic conferences to present our findings, which is a perk for those who value recognition).
* **Agile and Mission-Focused:** Being a startup, we emphasize agility and avoiding bureaucracy. We make sure every team member sees the direct impact of their work on our milestones (like participating in pilot deployments etc.). This sense of mission – that we’re transforming an industry – is a motivator beyond monetary aspects.
* **Training and Growth:** We will support continuous learning (e.g., internal tech talks, budget for online courses or certifications) given the fast-evolving nature of AI and 5G. Team members with interest can rotate roles (e.g., a researcher can accompany deployment team to learn field issues, and vice versa), promoting holistic growth.

In summary, we plan a controlled scale-up of our human resources, ensuring that at each stage we have the right skills in place without overstaffing too early. We believe our core team is extremely solid and can attract like-minded top talent (some of whom we already are in contact with through academic/industry networks). As we grow, maintaining the **innovative, interdisciplinary spirit** will be key – we want to avoid becoming siloed; our culture will emphasize collaboration between AI and telecom experts, which is our hallmark.

### 9. Funding Plan

**9.1 Overall Funding Strategy:** We plan to raise capital in stages corresponding with our development milestones, ensuring sufficient funding for R\&D and market entry, while managing dilution. Our principle is to secure enough capital to reach the next value-inflection point, at which our valuation naturally increases, thereby rewarding early investors and enabling subsequent raises on better terms. We foresee needing at least two major rounds (Seed/Angel and Series A), possibly a Series B, to reach profitability and significant scale. Below are details:

* **Seed Round (Current) – 2025:** **Target Amount:** \~¥20 million (approximately \$3 million). **Purpose:** This seed capital will fund 12–18 months focusing on product development and initial trials. Specifically: hiring the initial team (engineers and data scientists), purchasing development equipment and computing resources (including cloud GPU hours or on-prem hardware), building out the prototype, and covering operational expenses (office, utilities, etc.). A portion will also go to executing 1–2 pilot deployments (travel, equipment for test sites, etc.). **Status:** We are in discussions with several potential seed investors, including telecom-focused venture funds and government-guided innovation funds. **Valuation & Equity:** We anticipate a pre-money valuation around ¥80 million–100 million for the seed (given our strong IP and prototype progress). At ¥20 million raise, that implies \~20% equity given to seed investors. This preserves majority ownership (\~60–65%) with founders and team pre-Series A, which is important for alignment and control.

* **Series A (Expansion) – \~2026 H2:** **Target Amount:** \~¥80–100 million (\$12–15 million). **Purpose:** Series A will scale the company from successful prototype/pilot to a full product and initial commercial deployments. Uses of funds: expanding the team (from \~10 to ~~30 as outlined in HR plan, which significantly increases payroll costs), product refinement and hardening (making the software robust, adding features like the cloud platform), larger pilot projects or limited production deployments (which might involve subsidizing some deployments to prove efficacy), marketing and business development efforts, as well as working capital. We also expect to invest in infrastructure such as more powerful servers for model training (or hefty cloud compute contracts). **Investors:** For Series A, we will target leading VC firms that specialize in deep-tech/TMT, and potentially strategic investors (e.g., an investment arm of a telecom operator or a major equipment vendor) to not only provide capital but also create partnership opportunities. **Valuation & Equity:** If seed milestones are met (e.g., working prototype, a pilot success, maybe small revenue), we would aim for a significant step-up in valuation. Possibly pre-money valuation of ¥300–400 million (~~\$45–60 million), so raising \~¥100 million would dilute \~20–25%. We are mindful to keep dilution moderate to retain incentive for founders and early team (post-Series A, cumulative dilution \~40–45% which is reasonable).

* **Series B (Scaling/Growth) – \~2028:** **Target Amount:** \~¥200–300 million (\$30–45 million). **Purpose:** This round would be to truly scale the business globally and reach breakeven or profitability. Funds would be used for wide-scale deployments (by now we might need to finance some deployments or hardware initially to accelerate adoption), expansion to new markets (setting up offices or partnerships abroad), continued R\&D for new product versions (like scaling model sizes, tackling core network AI, etc.), and potentially manufacturing specialized hardware if any (though we’re mostly software, we may bundle accelerator cards etc., but likely partners handle hardware). Also, by this time, we might spend on compliance (security audits, certifications) and substantial customer support infrastructure. **Investors:** Likely larger institutional investors or late-stage VCs. It might also involve strategic participation from an entity like a large telco or tech giant if not already involved. We could also consider an international investor to help global expansion. **Valuation & Exit Prep:** By Series B, assuming we have multi-million USD revenue and key contracts, valuation might be in the ¥1–2 billion range (\$150–300 million). We would position this as possibly the last private round before an IPO. This round’s terms could be influenced by whether we lean towards an IPO in China (STAR Market, etc.) or abroad. We’ll ensure investors are amenable to our exit route.

* **Exit Path:** We outline a few possibilities for investor exit:

  * **IPO:** The preferred path if we achieve strong growth is to go public on a suitable exchange by \~2029–2030. The Shanghai STAR Market or Shenzhen ChiNext (which are oriented towards high-tech firms) are natural choices given policy support for AI/semiconductor companies. Alternatively, Hong Kong or even NASDAQ (depending on geopolitical climate) could be considered to tap global capital. An IPO would provide liquidity to investors and capital for further expansion. We anticipate being IPO-ready once annual revenues and profitability stabilize (e.g., >¥200 million revenue as per 2029 projection, which should be attractive for STAR Market where tech IPOs often happen earlier than traditional markets).
  * **Strategic Acquisition:** Given the interest from big players, another route is being acquired by a major telecom equipment vendor or cloud company. For example, Huawei or Ericsson could acquire us to internalize our technology if they see it as strategically crucial. Or a cloud/AI company wanting to enter telecom might buy us. If such an acquisition occurs, it would likely be at a high multiple if we hold unique IP. Our investors could realize returns possibly faster via this route. We remain open to this provided the valuation and conditions are favorable (ensuring our tech vision can continue within the larger company).
  * **Mergers/Secondary Sales:** It’s possible that by Series B, some early investors may cash out part of their stake through secondary transactions (selling to new investors) if an IPO is further out. We will facilitate reasonable secondary liquidity if needed to keep investor support strong. Also, a merger with a complementary company (maybe an AI or software firm in a related area) could be a possibility, though not our primary plan.

Throughout, we will manage funds prudently: focusing spending on R\&D and field validations early, then on go-to-market and scale later. We also plan to supplement equity financing with **non-dilutive funds** whenever possible: applying to grants (we expect a couple million RMB from government programs potentially), and using customer revenue to co-fund growth (for instance, structure some deals where customer pre-pays or co-funds development, which reduces our capital need).

**9.2 Funding Risk & Mitigation:** We recognize risks like not being able to raise the full desired amount or at good terms. To mitigate:

* We are structuring our milestones such that each successful step significantly de-risks the venture, making next raises easier. For example, demonstrating the 97% accuracy and pilot results already makes us credible for seed; similarly a successful pilot makes Series A pitch compelling (with operator testimonial perhaps).
* We keep our burn rate lean until we see proof points, so if fundraising is delayed, we can extend runway by focusing on core development (our current seed ask can stretch 18 months by prioritizing must-do tasks).
* We also line up multiple investor options (mix of financial VCs and strategics) to maintain bargaining power. If, hypothetically, market conditions are bad in 2026 for raising, we could possibly survive longer on seed money by deferring some hires, or seek a bridge loan or convertible from a friendly entity (like a government innovation fund or even customers – sometimes operators invest in startups whose tech they want).
* In the worst case scenario where scaling funding is limited, we would adapt by narrowing focus to a niche profitable segment (e.g., focusing only on high-value private networks or selling specific modules like spectrum engine which might generate revenue earlier), to sustain the business until environment improves.

Our financial projections (see Section 10) incorporate the assumption of raising needed capital to execute growth. We anticipate that by 2027–2028, the business could start funding itself (operating cash flow positive), reducing dependence on external financing thereafter, aligning with an IPO timeline.

Investors can take comfort that our plan has multiple optionality: either become a standalone public company riding the 6G wave or an attractive acquisition target for industry leaders. In both outcomes, early backers stand to earn substantial returns (we estimate potential 10x return for seed by Series B/IPO if we hit milestones, given the valuation jumps that deep-tech companies see upon proving market traction, not to mention even higher if we become a standard essential solution by 6G).

In closing, our funding plan seeks to balance ambition with prudence – raising enough to seize the opportunity and be a category leader, while carefully managing dilution and aligning funding with key proof points. We will keep stakeholders updated transparently and adjust the plan as needed to ensure the company’s financial health and growth trajectory.

### 10. Financial Projections (3–5 Year Forecast)

We have developed a financial model for the next five years (2025–2029) reflecting our anticipated revenue ramp-up, expenses (especially R\&D), and profitability timeline. The table below summarizes key figures (in millions of RMB):

**Table 1: Projected Financials for 2025–2029** (in ¥ millions)

| Year     | Revenue (¥M) | R\&D Expense (¥M) | Net Profit (¥M) |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------------- | --------------- |
| **2025** | 0            | 5                 | -5              |
| **2026** | 2            | 6                 | -4              |
| **2027** | 20           | 8                 | 2               |
| **2028** | 80           | 10                | 50              |
| **2029** | 200          | 15                | 140             |

*(Note: Currency in millions of RMB; 1 USD ≈ 7 RMB for reference. Figures are rounded for simplicity.)*

**Revenue:** We expect minimal revenue in the first two years, as focus is on R\&D and pilots. By 2027, we forecast meaningful revenue (\~¥20M) as initial commercial contracts kick in – perhaps comprising a couple of smaller operator deals and a few enterprise projects. The big jump happens in 2028 and 2029, where we scale deployments across larger portions of networks. By 2029, we project ¥200M revenue (≈ \$30M), which assumes capturing multiple large contracts (for instance, licensing software for a few thousand base stations and significant subscription fees from cloud services). This growth represents roughly a doubling or more year-over-year in later years, reflecting the tipping point when our solution gains broad acceptance and word-of-mouth.

**R\&D Expense:** We commit a significant portion of our budget to R\&D throughout the period. In absolute terms, R\&D spend grows from ¥5M in 2025 to ¥15M by 2029, but as a percentage of revenue it drops from >100% in early years to a modest \~7.5% by 2029. Initially (2025–2026), R\&D cost is high relative to revenue because we’re developing product (engineer salaries, computing resources are major components). We plan for R\&D spending to continue rising modestly even as the company becomes profitable – reflecting continuous innovation (like developing next-gen models and features), but at a rate slower than revenue growth, giving operating leverage.

**Net Profit:** We forecast **two years of initial losses** (which is typical for a deep-tech startup) – approximately -¥5M in 2025 (mostly seed capital consumption on R\&D) and -¥4M in 2026. These losses are manageable within our planned funding. By 2027, as revenues come in, we hit roughly **break-even** with a slight net profit of \~¥2M. Importantly, from 2028 onward, profitability accelerates dramatically due to high gross margins on software. We project a net profit of ¥50M in 2028 (62.5% net margin on ¥80M revenue) and ¥140M in 2029 (70% net margin on ¥200M revenue). Such high margins are achievable because once our R\&D is done, each additional license or subscription sale has very low cost – this is characteristic of enterprise software businesses.

**Gross Margin & Cost Structure:** Our gross margin is expected to be \~85–90% since cost of sales is low (a bit of deployment support and cloud hosting costs). Main expenses are **operating expenses**: R\&D (discussed), Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative. We anticipate Sales & Marketing expenses to rise from virtually nothing in 2025 to perhaps \~¥20M by 2029 as we build a sales force and marketing presence (not shown in table, but considered in profit calc). G\&A will also rise as we grow (HR, admin, etc.), but we’ll keep it lean.

**Cash Flow & Funding Needs:** Our projections indicate we would still be cash-flow negative in 2025–2026, turning positive around 2027 when net profit starts. The cumulative loss over 2025–2026 is small (\~¥9M), which is well covered by our seed funding plan. Additional fundraising (Series A) supports 2027–2028 growth investments until revenues really scale. By 2028, we are strongly cash-flow positive, meaning we could potentially fund some expansion from our own profits or be in a comfortable position for IPO (investors love seeing profitability plus growth).

We should highlight that **R\&D investment remains significant** even after break-even – we will continue to allocate substantial budget to maintain tech leadership (but as a fraction of revenue, it becomes smaller, demonstrating scalability of the business).

**Chart: Projected Revenue and Profit Growth (2025–2029)**

【GraphCursor†embed\_image】*Figure 4: Projected five-year growth of revenue (blue) and net profit (green) in ¥ millions.*

The above line chart illustrates our financial trajectory, where revenue ramps up steeply from 2027 onwards and net profit crosses into positive territory and accelerates. The divergence between the revenue and profit lines after 2027 highlights increasing profitability due to operating leverage.

By 2029, the model indicates net profit margin \~70%, which is plausible for a mature software licensing business (for instance, many enterprise software firms operate with 20-30% net margins; ours could be higher because of lower sales overhead with a few big clients and high recurring revenue share). We might choose to reinvest some of that profit into further R\&D or market expansion, but it shows the potential for strong earnings.

**Financial Model Assumptions:**

* We assume an average license fee per base station (or per equivalent unit) and an average subscription per customer, then multiply by anticipated adoption numbers. For example, our 2029 revenue might break down as: \~¥150M from licensing (e.g., 15,000 sites at ¥10k each, or fewer sites at higher per-site fees for advanced features) and \~¥50M from recurring cloud services (e.g., 50 customers paying ¥1M each annually on average for subscriptions).
* We assume continued moderate R\&D team growth (R\&D expense +25% YoY 2025–2027 then leveling).
* Sales & marketing expense: relatively low until 2027 (since deals are few and direct), ramping in 2028–29 as we handle multiple customers (we assumed \~10% of revenue by 2029).
* Taxation: as a new tech firm in China, we likely get some tax incentives (maybe a reduced income tax rate of 15% as “High and New Tech Enterprise”), but for simplicity in net profit we didn’t explicitly deduct tax; in practice, the margins reported would be after tax if actual profit were taxed.

**Break-even Analysis:** We effectively break-even in 2027 at around ¥20M revenue. This implies a high contribution margin – meaning each contract beyond fixed R\&D costs flows heavily to profit. This is expected in software: once dev costs are covered, additional sales are very profitable.

**Use of Funds:** The above outlay aligns with our funding plan: seed + Series A cover negative cash flows and investment through 2027; Series B (if needed) would fund aggressive expansion in 2028–2029, but our model shows that by 2029 we might fund a lot from internal profits, reducing dependency on external capital at that stage.

Investors will note that by 2029, with ¥140M net profit, even a conservative P/E multiple of 20 would value the company at ¥2.8 billion (\$400M). Given high growth, it could command higher multiples. This shows the strong return potential relative to earlier valuations (which were in tens or low hundreds of million RMB).

**Financial Sensitivity & Outlook:** If adoption is slower (say we achieve only half the 2029 revenue), the business would still be profitable but at a smaller scale (maybe \~¥100M revenue, ¥50M profit), which is still a successful outcome justifying investment, though likely we could not IPO by then. If adoption is faster (e.g., a big standardization win), revenue could exceed forecast (some upside scenarios show possibly ¥300M+ by 2029 if multiple big operators deploy widely), which would further boost profit (with margins possibly slightly lower if we invest more in support, but still very healthy).

Our model doesn’t explicitly account for royalties or patent licensing income (if our tech becomes part of standards, we might get licensing fees from others, which could be non-trivial). That could be additional upside.

**Key Financial Risks:** One risk is that our sales cycle takes longer, pushing revenue ramp by a year or two. We have some buffer via funding planning for that. Another risk is currency or macro: if we expand internationally, FX or economic slowdowns could affect operator spending. We’ve built projections mostly on China market which remains strong under policy support; global expansion would be icing on the cake financially.

In conclusion, our financial projections illustrate a path from careful investment in early years to robust profitability by year 5. The figures reinforce that once we secure a foothold, the economics of our model are attractive: high recurring revenue, scalable with minimal incremental cost, and a relatively concentrated customer base (a few large clients can drive big revenue). This is aligned with typical enterprise software dynamics, which have historically produced high valuations.

We will continuously revisit our financial plan as real data comes in, and we’ll keep a close eye on maintaining positive cash flow once we hit break-even, to ensure financial stability.

### 11. Risk Analysis and Mitigation

Despite the significant promise of our venture, we must carefully consider potential risks and challenges. We identify the major risks below along with our strategies to mitigate them:

* **Technical Feasibility & Performance Risk:** *Description:* There’s a risk that the AI agent may not perform as well in the real world as in controlled tests. For instance, the LLM might struggle with corner cases in RRC procedures or may introduce unpredictable behaviors. Also, integrating the AI into a live network without causing issues is technically complex. *Mitigation:* We address this by extensive testing and a **gradual deployment approach**. We will not start by replacing critical control logic all at once; instead, our agent can run in parallel (shadow mode) to validate decisions against the legacy system before taking over. We use closed-loop simulations (digital twin) to test as many scenarios as possible. Moreover, we’ve designed a fallback mechanism—if the AI output falls outside expected parameters or times out, the system can revert to standard RRC logic, ensuring continuity of service. Our initial field trials are deliberately in low-stakes environments (or limited scope) to iron out issues before any wide-scale rollout. Furthermore, our core team’s expertise and prior research reduce risk: we already achieved compliance in generating RRC messages, indicating our approach is sound. We will continue improving model accuracy and robustness (e.g., training with more diverse data and injecting domain constraints into the model). In summary, careful validation, incremental introduction, and safety nets mitigate technical risk.

* **Adoption & Market Risk:** *Description:* Telecom operators are conservative; they might be hesitant to trust a new AI system with critical network functions. There’s risk of a “pilot purgatory” where we run trials but the operator doesn’t move to full deployment. Also, if broader industry sentiment turns against AI (e.g., concern about unpredictability), it could slow adoption. *Mitigation:* We plan to deliver clear, quantifiable value in our pilots (e.g., X% drop in call setup time, Y% reduction in outages) to build a strong business case. We will gather extensive KPI data and perhaps involve third-party benchmarking (like if an operator’s internal lab validates improvements). This data-driven approach helps convince the skeptical. We’re also packaging our solution to not require an “all-or-nothing” leap – it can be deployed incrementally and co-exist with existing systems, which lowers the barrier to try. To build trust, we’ll provide transparency: for example, our AI can generate logs or even explanations for its decisions (the LLM’s ability to provide self-explanation can be harnessed as a feature to satisfy engineers that it’s making reasonable decisions). We’re also working closely with influential bodies (government programs, standards groups) – an endorsement or involvement by them gives operators cover to try something new. Overcoming inertia often requires a reference customer: our strategy is to secure one major reference (perhaps a proactive operator or enterprise known for innovation) – their success will create FOMO among peers. As for general AI skepticism, we emphasize that our solution doesn’t “black box” the network – it’s constrained by standards and we can demonstrate deterministic fail-safes. We’ll also integrate with existing network management tools so operators feel in control (e.g., they can set policies for the AI agent). Education is part of the mitigation: we will train operator staff on how the system works and how to supervise it, turning them into champions rather than opponents.

* **Competition Risk:** *Description:* Competitors (startups or large companies) might catch up or offer alternative solutions, potentially outcompeting us on either performance or customer relationships. A big vendor could introduce a similar AI feature built into their equipment, making it hard for us to sell separately. *Mitigation:* Our approach is to maintain a **technology edge** via continuous R\&D and to secure **IP protection**. We’ve fine-tuned unique LLM models and filed patents on our techniques (e.g., domain-specific tokenization, protocol-emulating AI). This makes it hard for a competitor to quickly replicate our results without infringing or spending the years we already invested. We will also move fast to capture market share (“landgrab” strategy in terms of integrating with operators early) – once our solution is part of an operator’s network and proving value, switching to a competitor would be non-trivial (we’ll aim to integrate deeply, e.g., with their NMS/OSS, to increase stickiness). With incumbents, we mitigate by partnering: e.g., offer our solution to vendors as a complement rather than a competitor component. If say Ericsson or Huawei has an in-house AI, we differentiate by focusing on multi-vendor environments or by offering our solution to other vendors who don’t have that capability. Additionally, we keep our **focus on a specialized niche (control-plane AI)** whereas many might focus on easier wins like network optimization – this gives us a space where we can be the best. If a giant enters our niche, we consider strategic moves such as collaboration or even acquisition discussions (ensuring investor value is recognized). Because our team is relatively unique (mix of AI and 3GPP protocol mastery), even large companies might find partnership or acquisition more attractive than building from scratch. In summary, continuous innovation, quick market penetration, and strategic alignment with bigger players reduce competitive threats.

* **Talent & Execution Risk:** *Description:* As a cutting-edge tech startup, we heavily rely on highly skilled engineers. There’s a risk of not being able to hire or retain the needed talent, especially with competition from big tech companies for AI expertise. Execution-wise, we’re a small team attempting complex deliverables – miscoordination or overextension could slow progress. *Mitigation:* We have founding team members with stellar backgrounds, which helps attract top talent (people want to work with known experts). We also offer meaningful equity and a chance to work on world-first technology, which appeals to the kind of pioneering engineers and researchers we seek. We’ve also engaged interns and collaborators via our academic connections, forming a pipeline of young talent. To retain talent, apart from equity and competitive salaries (which our funding covers), we focus on creating a rewarding environment: challenging projects, recognition (we encourage team members to publish papers/patents – engineers in our domain value that), and a culture of respect and learning (which can often beat corporate bureaucracy). We’re mindful of burnout – we plan realistic timelines and encourage work-life balance to sustain productivity for the marathon that is deep-tech development. For execution management, we’ve set clear milestones (as described in our roadmap), and we use an agile approach – breaking tasks into sprints with frequent reviews to catch issues early. Also, by phasing our goals (prototype, pilot, etc.), we ensure the team isn’t trying to boil the ocean at once – focus is key. We supplement any skill gaps by consulting with our advisors (e.g., if a tricky RAN integration issue arises, our advisor Prof. Wang or contacts at labs can provide insights). If necessary, we’ll hire specialized contractors for short-term needs (for example, a cybersecurity expert to review our product before deployment, rather than keeping one full-time initially). These measures keep our team effective and our execution on track.

* **Financial & Funding Risk:** *Description:* We are reliant on external capital to reach positive cashflow. There is a risk that we could face a cash crunch if funding rounds don’t close as expected or if revenue is delayed. Market conditions for fundraising might deteriorate (e.g., if there’s a downturn or shifts in investor sentiment). *Mitigation:* We have planned our funding in alignment with key milestones – meeting those should significantly increase our valuation and attractiveness, thus improving funding odds. That is, we don’t go back to market empty-handed; we go with “we promised X, we achieved X, now raising to do Y”. Additionally, we maintain a **buffer in our financial plan** – for instance, the seed raise of ¥20M covers 18 months at our projected burn; we will control costs to extend that to maybe 24 months if needed by prioritizing crucial hires and deferring some expenses (e.g., we might wait on some marketing spend until we have more results). We’re also seeking some non-dilutive funds: we are applying for government grants (which often in China can provide a few million RMB for high-tech startups in strategically favored fields). Winning such a grant (for which we have good chances given alignment with national priorities) can supplement runway and reduce reliance on equity capital. As for bridging to revenue, we will also consider **early revenue streams**: if an operator is excited about a pilot, we might structure it as a paid POC or get them to cover certain costs. In the event of a worst-case scenario (e.g., a major funding delay), we can slow certain activities (maybe delay international expansion or non-critical R\&D) to conserve cash, focusing on keeping the core development going until funding situation improves or revenue kicks in. Also importantly, by 2027 we anticipate being near break-even – meaning after Series A we might manage with smaller top-ups unless scaling aggressively. This self-sufficiency reduces long-term funding risk.

* **Regulatory & Security Risk:** *Description:* Telecom networks are critical infrastructure. Regulators might be wary of letting an AI system control the network due to concerns over stability or security. If an incident (network outage) occurs and is blamed (rightly or wrongly) on the AI, regulators could impose restrictions. Also, handling network data raises security and privacy considerations – our system might be subject to cybersecurity scrutiny. *Mitigation:* We are building our system with compliance in mind. For example, our AI agent can be configured to **not persist or leak sensitive user data** – it works on real-time ephemeral data and we can ensure any logs are anonymized. We will engage early with regulatory bodies (like in China, the MIIT’s network technology labs, etc.) to get guidance on safety requirements and perhaps certification. We might volunteer our system for evaluation in a government-run network test before large scale rollout, to get an official nod. In terms of reliability, as mentioned, we keep all standard fail-safes intact – e.g., even with our agent, the network’s existing alarm and override systems remain in place. We plan to implement an “explainability” feature – at least logging the reasons for key decisions – which could alleviate regulatory/engineer concerns because it shows the AI isn’t a mysterious black box. To address security, we will subject our software to third-party penetration testing and comply with telecom security standards (like NESAS in telecom equipment). Our cloud component (for those who use it) will use robust encryption and abide by data localization laws (e.g., in China, data stays in China). We also keep an option for operators to run the AI entirely on-premises (without cloud connectivity) if they prefer, thus aligning with those who have strict policies. By proactively addressing these concerns, we aim to either avoid regulatory issues or be well-prepared to handle them.

In conclusion, while we face a range of risks – technical, market, competitive, operational, financial – we have strategies in place for each. Our overall philosophy is to be proactive: anticipate issues (through early testing, customer feedback loops, compliance checks) rather than react late. We will also purchase appropriate insurance (for example, errors & omissions insurance if required for software liability when we deploy in big networks) to further mitigate impacts of worst-case scenarios. By systematically managing these risks, we improve our odds of delivering on the project’s immense potential with minimal hiccups.
